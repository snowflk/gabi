Euro Latest: EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY Levels to Watch	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/12/22/Euro-Latest-EURUSD-EURGBP-EURJPY-Levels-to-Watch.html	1608633000	The new strain of Covid-19 spreads across Europe $$$$EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, and EUR/JPY levels to watch.	EUR/USD is trading a little softer this morning as the pair reacts to the approval of a stimulus package in the US and the ongoing talks regarding Brexit. In what was a general risk-off day yesterday, EUR/USD retreated to last week’s low but found support at the da-day moving average at 1.2130. $$$$The discovery of a new strain of the virus added to the worsening of the health condition in many countries, which put downside pressure on risk-on assets that were already venturing far into overbought territory. This I turn led to an increase in demand in the US Dollar as a safe-haven, which rose to just under 91.00, its highest value in 10 days.$$$$Given the proximity of the Christmas holiday, I’m expecting to see consolidation at current prices for the next few days in the absence of a risk event, but a reduction in liquidity in the days between Christmas and New Year could see volatility increase rapidly. $$$$EUR/USD Daily chart.$$$$Looking at the daily chart, the rising support trendline formed by connecting the lows since November 4th continues to be an important area going forward. If downside pressure sees another fall below this line, 1.2120 comes in as the next area of support, with a fall below 1.20 seen as the objective for sellers. On the upside, we need to see a break above 1.2270 to start considering a possible push towards 1.24.$$$$The UK and EU have sent 54 months trying to decide how to define their relationship past December 1st 2021, and whilst the pound was taking advantage of what seemed to be a possible light at the end of the tunnel, it only took 24 hours for the coronavirus to steal the spotlight and send the pound crashing on Monday after the UK was left virtually isolated from the rest of Europe to avoid the spread of this new strain.$$$$EUR/GBP has been highly volatile since the beginning of the month, as news headlines about Brexit took over market sentiment. Prior to December, the pair had been in a clear downward trajectory which was expected to culminate in a break of key support at 0.8863, but the fear the UK would leave the EU without a deal took over, meaning the pound was left weakening against an already strong euro. $$$$EUR/GBP Daily Chart.$$$$We are now about halfway of the range that has been in play for the most part of the last 6 months, from 0.8863 to 0.9223, after the pair touched the upper side of the range in yesterday’s session. Direction is very unclear at this point, as momentum can change rapidly when new Brexit headlines come out, but for now, the 23.6% Fibonacci at 0.9223 seems to be a good lid for the pair. $$$$The RSI has exited the overbought area and the stochastic is hovering around the 50-line, which could mean that further weakness may be seen in the short-term, with the 38.2% Fibonacci at 0.9040 being the next key support. $$$$EUR/JPY has been trading with a neutral bias in the last few weeks, holding just above the 125.75 line, but momentum indicators are beginning to point to weakening support for the euro, with a bearish bias in the short-run. $$$$On the upside, a break above 127.05 resistance would challenge the high since March 2019 at 127.60. Further buying pressure would turn short-term momentum bullish and could see 129.35 come into play as the next objective, being the highest level since November 2018. $$$$To the downside, the 20-day moving average is acting as the main support at 126.16, followed by 125.70 before leaving EUR/JPY exposed to the 125.00 mark. Further bearish momentum could see the pair reverse the gains seen in December, falling back towards 124.45, where the 50-day and 100-day moving averages are converging. $$$$EUR/JPY Daily Chart.$$$$--- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Market Analyst.$$$$Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin.

EUR/USD Price Analysis & News.$$$$Aside from the Pound, G10 FX has been unsurprisingly muted as markets wind down for the Christmas period. All eyes remain on an official announcement of a Brexit deal, which is within the next few hours. In light of the risk-on catalyst, safe-haven currencies (JPY, CHF) are on the backfoot against high-beta FX.$$$$ G10 FX Intra-day Performance.$$$$The pair continues to hover around the 1.22 mark with recent gains underpinned by the wave of Brexit optimism. However, an offsetting factor for a push higher in the Euro is likely due to the pullback in EUR/GBP which has hit fresh 3-week lows. Topside challenges remain at the high 1.22s, while key support is situated at 1.2120-30.

DAX 30 Consolidation Threatened as EUR/USD Strengthens	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/12/02/DAX-30-Consolidation-Threatened-as-EURUSD-Strengthens--.html	1606905000	Vaccine hopes keep equities supported.$$$$EUR/USD pushes to highest level since 2018 above 1.20.$$$$DAX 30 struggles to clear key resistance as rising wedge pattern starts to form 	Renewed hopes of an efficient vaccine rollout keep global equities supported for the meantime, but profit-taking and defensive hedging could be what keeps markets capped towards the end of the year. Also, a weakening US Dollar has led EUR/USD to push above 1.20 and hit its highest level since 2018, which is a detriment to those European companies heavily reliant on exports. $$$$EUR/USD Weekly Chart $$$$Focusing on German stocks, the trend has been upbeat since the recovery from the March lows began and the DAX 30 has been the only European stock index to reach the levels seen pre-pandemic, even before positive vaccine news broke out at the beginning of November. This is partly due to the fact that both value and growth stocks comprise the DAX and therefore the German index was able to receive some safe haven flows once the recovery got underway. Also, the German economy has always been perceived to be stronger than the rest of Europe, so capital would have felt safer being placed in the DAX than other European indices.$$$$But this positive differentiation in the recovery stages can also be a detriment once markets stabilise, which is what we’re seeing now. Capital rotation from safer investments is likely to move to riskier assets, slightly limiting the upside potential of assets considered to be safer, which is to some extent what we can expect to see happen to the DAX compared to other European indices. This effect is expected to be less obvious than in other stock indices like the Nasdaq which are mostly made up of growth stocks, given that the German stock index also has some value stocks which are outperforming on positive vaccine news. $$$$DAX 30 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS.$$$$The DAX 30 also managed to push higher this past week but an important horizontal resistance at 13,325 and 13,400 showed to be tough areas for buyers to crack. Upside momentum has been halted for several days now at these levels, but we can expect the German Index to continue its attempt to push higher. If so, the next area which may offer resistance is located between 13,530 and 13,600, where bullish momentum was softened in various instances back at the beginning of 2020 and before the coronavirus outbreak.$$$$As mentioned previously, overbought conditions are now present for the DAX 30 so a short-term downside correction should not be a surprise. Short-term support can be found at the ascending trendline connecting the higher lows since the 13th of November, currently at 13,290, with the 13,000 mark as the next area for bears to target. This trendline can also be seen as a rising wedge by connecting the highs since November 9th, which would be considered a bearish sign.$$$$DAX 30 Daily Chart.$$$$Learn more about the stock market basics here or download our free trading guides. $$$$--- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Market Analyst.$$$$Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin.
EUR/USD Rates May Dismiss ECB Easing and Extend Push to Yearly Highs	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/12/08/EURUSD-Rates-May-Dismiss-ECB-Easing-and-Extend-Push-to-Yearly-Highs.html	1607475600	The upcoming ECB monetary policy meeting may have little impact on the near-term trajectory of the Euro. $$$$EUR/USD seems poised to extend its recent rally after slicing through Bull Flag resistance. 	The Euro has surged over 2% against the US Dollar in December, pushing to its highest levels since April 2018. This impulsive topside push looks set to extend in the near term, despite the European Central Bank flagging further monetary policy easing at its upcoming meeting on December 10. $$$$The central bank’s November meeting minutes stated that “members widely agreed that, given the sharper slowdown in growth momentum and the weakening of underlying inflation dynamics compared with what had previously been expected, it would be warranted to recalibrate the monetary policy instruments in December”. $$$$The ECB is expected to expand its €1.35 trillion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) and offer new long-term loans to banks through Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs), with President Christine Lagarde stating that these “remain the main tools for adjusting our monetary policy”.  $$$$DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$Yet, the International Monetary Fund has urged the ECB to consider options outside of expanding assets purchases given the notable stagnation in consumer price growth in the European Union. The trading bloc has recorded four straight months of deflation, with headline inflation flatlining at a record low of -0.3%. $$$$Indeed, there appears to be an outside chance that the central bank may consider lowering interest rates further, after Governing Council member Klaas Knot said that “we wouldn’t want to exclude any measure going into December”, when questioned on the matter in a recent interview. Markets are currently pricing in a 25% chance of a rate cut at the upcoming meeting. $$$$Euro-Area Inflation Rate.$$$$Source – TradingEconomics.$$$$However, it appears these calls may go unanswered by the central bank in the near term at least, with Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel stating that “I think it’s appropriate to focus on preserving these conditions rather than easing much further”. $$$$Schnabel added that “what’s clear is that since the beginning of the pandemic, PEPP and TLTROs have proven highly effective and are therefore likely to be the main instruments for recalibration”. $$$$Therefore, the absence of more aggressive easing from the ECB may buoy the Euro in the short term and allow the currency to continue pressing higher against its major counterparts. $$$$EUR/USD weekly chart created using Tradingview $$$$From a technical perspective, EUR/USD rates appear to be eyeing a push to challenge the 2018 high (1.2556), after bursting above Bull Flag resistance and slicing through the 2017 high (1.2092). $$$$With prices tracking firmly above all four moving averages, the path of least resistance seems to favour the upside. $$$$Remaining constructively perched above psychological support at 1.2100 would likely open the door for price to probe the 50% Fibonacci (1.2290), with a weekly close above 1.2300 bringing the 2018 high into play. $$$$Alternatively, slipping back below the 2017 high could inspire a pullback towards the July high (1.1909). $$$$EUR/USD daily chart created using Tradingview $$$$Zooming into a daily chart reinforces the bullish outlook depicted on the weekly timeframe, as prices continue to hold firmly above the 2017 high (1.2092) and psychological support at 1.2100. $$$$A daily close above the December 6 high (1.2178) would probably neutralize near-term selling pressure and carve a path for price to test the 50% Fibonacci (1.2290). $$$$Conversely, breaching psychological support could trigger a short-term correction towards the September high (1.2011), with a daily close below bringing the trend-defining 50-day moving average (1.1878) into focus.$$$$The IG Client Sentiment Report shows 30.73% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 2.25 to 1.The number of traders net-long is 8.09% higher than yesterday and 37.50% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 0.27% higher than yesterday and 4.50% lower from last week.$$$$We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.$$$$Yet traders are less net-short than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EUR/USD price trend may soon reverse lower despite the fact traders remain net-short.$$$$-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX.$$$$Follow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss.
US Dollar Selling Persists, EUR/USD Nearing 1.20, GBP/JPY to Outperform	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/11/30/USD-EURUSD-GBPJPY.html	1606732200	EUR/USD Approaching 1.2000 $$$$Watch Out for Possible Month-End USD Selling into London Fix.$$$$GBP/JPY Tends to Outperforms on Last Trading Day After Strong Monthly SPX Gains.	US Dollar Analysis & News.$$$$The USD has begun the week, much how it had finished last week, on the backfoot as month-end flows dictates G10 FX. The notable beneficiary has been the Euro which is looking to make a retest of the 1.20 handle. However, while there may be rising concerns of ECB verbal intervention again as EUR/USD nears 1.20, there is a sense that this time it may be different. The key reason being that the Euro TWI is not at multi-year highs as it was in the Summer, meaning that the FX passthrough into a softer inflation outlook is lower. $$$$EUR/USDvs EUR TWI.$$$$Source: Refinitiv.$$$$Watch Out for Possible USD Selling into London Fix.$$$$This month has seen a stellar rise in equity markets following a Biden victory and recent vaccine optimism with the S&P 500 posting its second-best monthly gain this year (rising 11%). In turn, the consensus is for above-average month-end USD selling into the London 4pm fix. As a reminder, back in April after the S&P 500 saw 12% monthly rise, the USD had come under heavy selling in the run-up (between 1500-1600) to the month-end London fix. $$$$Source: Refinitiv.$$$$Another observation is that whenever the S&P 500 has had a monthly gain over 3%, GBP/JPY has tended to perform well into the London fix. That said, while markets remain on Brexit headline watch, I don’t rule out another strong performer into the fix. $$$$Source: Refinitiv.
Euro Outlook: EUR/USD Hitting Resistance, EUR/GBP Upside Faded	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/12/01/Euro-Outlook-EURUSD-Hitting-Resistance-EURGBP-Upside-Faded.html	1606814100	EUR/USD Rejects 1.20 Again EUR/USD.$$$$EUR/GBP Rallies to be Faded.$$$$German Labour Market Remains Firm Despite Lockdown 2.0.	EUR/USD, EURGBP Price Analysis & News.$$$$EUR/USD Rejects 1.20 Again: With month-end noise out of the way, markets can now focus on the longer-term themes. Yesterday’s price action had been rather choppy with EUR/USD once again failing to convincingly break above 1.20. However, dips have been short-lived with the USD based view that rallies in the greenback are likely to be faded. Particularly as the longer-term view remains that 2021 will see a strong cyclical rebound thus benefitting USD counterparts. In the option space, sizeable expiries at 1.20 (1.7bln expiring on Friday) looks set to magnetise spot Euro. In turn, dips are likely to find good support, particularly down towards 1.1920 as long as markets remain risk-on. Elsewhere, on the data front, market focus will be on the ISM Manufacturing PMI, where a firmer than expected reading could see a brief pullback in EUR/USD.$$$$Short-Term Technicals.$$$$Support: 1.1950, 1.1900, 1.1870Resistance: 1.1980, 1.2000, 1.2030.$$$$EUR/GBP Rallies to be Faded: The bias remains for EUR/GBP rallies to be faded. While time is seemingly running out as we near the end of the transition period and with key issues yet to be resolved, the consensus remains that an EU-UK trade agreement will be struck, thus taking a no-deal off the table. Yesterday’s struggle at 0.90 reinforces the view that brief spikes in the cross will find firm resistance. That said, while the 0.8900 offers good support, 0.8860 is the key level on the downside where a close below opens up the door to a slide towards 0.8700.$$$$German Data Recap: The latest German jobs report reaffirms the case that the labour market remains a bright spark within the economy. Perhaps what is more surprising is that the better than expected report has also come at a time where a second national lockdown had been implemented. The German unemployment change fell by 39k, bringing down total unemployment seasonally adjusted to 2.817mln. The unemployment rate fell to 6.1% from 6.2% in October.$$$$According to the German labour market agency, the number of people on short-time work schemes, which have shielded the labour market from the brunt of the pandemic, fell to 2.22mln in compared to 2.6mln in the prior month and a peak of nearly 6mln reached in April at the height of the pandemic.$$$$10 Most Popular Candlestick Patterns.

This, however, should come as little surprise given that the US Dollar is hovering around its lowest level since April 2018. That said, while investors remain heavily short on the greenback, this does not mean that positioning cannot get shorter, particularly as markets begin to look to 2021 with recent vaccine optimism raising hopes of a faster global rebound than previously expected. Much of the USD selling had been against the Japanese Yen which saw net longs rising $1.2bln to total $4.8bln. $$$$GBP has seen a reduction in bearish bets for the first time in over a month. Although, positioning remains at odds with spot GBP, which continues to trade at elevated levels, despite a trade agreement between the EU and UK yet to be announced. Alongside this, with the reduction in net shorts, GBP/USD could potentially struggle to see a meaningful bounce on the back of an agreement with less shorts being unwound.$$$$Across the commodity currencies, short exposure in CAD and AUD had eased slightly with CAD tracking oil prices higher. NZD however, saw net longs pull back slightly, which is to be expected after recent surge following the pricing out of a negative OCR in NZ front end rates. That said, with a dovish RBNZ now fully priced out, the Kiwi may begin to underperform against the CAD and AUD.$$$$US Dollar  | $$$$EUR/USD | $$$$GBP/USD | $$$$USD/JPY | $$$$USD/CHF | $$$$USD/CAD | $$$$AUD/USD | $$$$NZD/USD | $$$$For a more in-depth analysis on FX, check out the FX Forecast 
DAX 30 Lacks Bullish Momentum, EUR/USD Buyers Eyeing Pullbacks	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/12/07/DAX-30-Lacks-Bullish-Momentum-EURUSD-Buyers-Eyeing-Pullbacks.html	1607337000	Brexit takes center stage as US-China tensions gain traction in the background.$$$$DAX 30 breaks below ascending wedge pattern.$$$$EUR/USD remains bullish in the long-run.	Asian equities were trading lower this morning as tensions between China and the US appear to be back on the table. Tensions escalated back in July when US consulates were closed in China in retaliation for the US having ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston. The Trump administration is now looking to sanction at least a dozen Chinese officials over their role in disqualifying elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.$$$$Closer to home, Brexit talks are still struggling to find common ground before the deadline at the end of the year, and news headlines are quickly gaining traction as speculation increases over the possibility of talks ending abruptly as the three main issues – fisheries, governance, and a level playing field – continue to be unresolved. $$$$This has brought back uncertainty in the markets after positive vaccine news in the month of November managed to remove a big part of the coronavirus drag. If we add that to the fact that we are nearing a holiday period, we may expect investors to be on the defensive with their positions, leaving many assets confined to a tight range going forward.$$$$Stock Market Holiday Calendar 2020/21.$$$$DAX 30 Daily chart.$$$$Looking at the daily chart, the DAX 30 confirmed the bearish breakout from the ascending wedge pattern pointed out last week, causing it to retreat to a two-week low at 13,160. This area has now shown short-term support, and so a break below this area could offer further selling pressure down towards the 13,000 mark, where stronger support currently stands. $$$$If price holds above this short-term support, we could see consolidation coming into play, shifting price sideways as investors await for the next catalyst to offer some direction. Momentum indicators have had a chance to reset from overbought conditions that were showing last week, so further upside might be achieved, although gains are likely to be capped around the 13,325 – 13,400 area of resistance. $$$$On the currency front, the euro remains a strong contender but the US Dollar is trying to claw back some losses against a basket of major currencies. EUR/USD managed a fresh two-year high on Friday at 1.2177 but price action quickly reversed and bearish pressure has followed through to start the new week. Although bullish conditions remain for the pair, short-term corrections are likely to arise as the ECB’s monetary policy announcement this Thursday may bring some tailwind risks given expectations of further extensions to the TLTRO program and an increase in PEPP by up to 500bn euros. $$$$A fall below 1.2075 may ramp up selling pressure towards the 1.20 mark, where buyer support is likely to increase. On the upside, a renewed push above 1.21 is likely to accelerate upside momentum towards last week’s high and possibly heading towards a new two-and-a-half-year high at around the 1.23 level. $$$$EUR/USD Weekly chart.$$$$Learn more about the stock market basics here or download our free trading guides. $$$$--- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Market Analyst.$$$$Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin.

That said, dips below 1.21 have been shortlived with initial support at 1.2070-75. However, with concerns remaining over Poland and Hungary maintaining their stance over the EU budget veto and with a dovish ECB meeting expected on Thursday, I do not rule out a pullback before the next leg higher. Keep in mind that while the ECB is expected to boost PEPP by another EUR 500bln, a lot of focus will be on the commentary surrounding the Euro given the speed of its appreciation.

Euro Latest: ECB to Focus on EUR/USD, EUR/GBP Strengthens as Brexit Hopes Diminish	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/12/10/Euro-Latest-ECB-to-Focus-on-EURUSD-EURGBP-Strengthens-as-Brexit-Hopes-Diminish.html	1607596200	The ECB may use verbal pushback to weaken a solid euro.$$$$Brexit talks continue to be at an impasse despite Johnson and von der Leyen meeting.$$$$EUR/USD and EUR/GBP key levels to watch.	The European Central Bank’s (ECB) monetary policy meeting today will be the main focus of euro traders as EUR/USD ventures into risky territory above the 1.20 line. It’s expected that its president, Christine Lagarde, is to announce an expansion of 500 billion euros to the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP), which would be positive for the common currency. But given reactionary measures are almost entirely priced in, it would take a much larger expansion than expected to shock markets and send the euro higher.$$$$The main focus today will be the press conference to be held after the announcement, where Lagarde may talk about the strength of the common currency and its negative effect on inflation, possibly signaling that the Bank will be keeping a close eye on its performance in the coming weeks. $$$$But the ECB might have little room to actually make a significant impact on weakening the EUR/USD exchange rate, given it is largely rising on the back of US Dollar weakness given improved expectations of economic recovery following positive vaccine developments, and expectations are for it to continue depreciating into 2021. $$$$And whilst the ECB does not officially target the exchange rate, Lagarde cannot ignore the euro’s rapid rise, so her aim will be to talk down the currency by hinting at possible policy action in the near future. $$$$In fact, Lagarde and other ECB board members will be speaking in the 24 hours after the meeting on Thursday, which is likely a tactic to allow for further policy talk depending on how markets react to the monetary meeting. $$$$EUR/USD4-hour Chart.$$$$EUR/USD has slipped below the 20-period moving average on the 4-hour chart, with the RSI falling towards the 30 line, which signals that bears are in control in the short-run.

Mixed December PMI Reports Hint at Further Uncertainty	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/12/16/Mixed-December-PMI-Reports-Hint-at-Further-Uncertainty.html	1608131340	Manufacturing Beats and Services Miss Forecast.$$$$Uncertainty and slowdowns in the path of economic recovery are high $$$$Mixed economic data may weigh on FOMC decision.	Services PMI prints at 55.3 versus the forecast of 55.9, Manufacturing PMI prints at 56.5 versus the forecast 55.7, and Composite PMI prints at 55.7.The Services PMI’s miss is especially concerning, as service activity accounts for around 75% of US GDP. $$$$The mixed US PMI data comes at the heels of surprisingly strong European numbers. Europe’s PMI prints for December saw beats across the board, with manufacturing printing at 55.5 (forecast = 53), services at 47.3 (forecast = 41.9), and the composite at 49.8 (forecast = 44). In the US, services face greater pressure from a resurgence in COVID cases. While US states have mostly not resorted to lockdowns like the ones implemented in parts of Europe, rising cases still weigh negatively on service activity. On the other hand, Manufacturing printed higher than expected, suggesting that this sector of the economy is better equipped to handle rising virus cases.$$$$PMI prints above 50 denote an expansion and below 50 denote a contraction. Services and Composite PMIs dipped into contractionary territory in February, followed in March by Manufacturing. All three bottomed in April before sharp rebounds through May and June. In July, all three crossed back into expansionary territory and have remained there since. While August, September, and October prints remained relatively flat, November’s saw new pandemic highs for the indices. Forecasts for December expected declines in all three indices, so today’s increase in Manufacturing and decline in Services suggest further uncertainty about the path of economic recovery. $$$$The mixed PMI data comes shortly after a large miss on retail sales data (-1.1% actual vs. -0.3% forecasted). Leading into the holiday season, a retail sales miss is worrying for the overall health of the economy. Other economic signs remain mixed. Consumer sentiment and inflation expectations have risen to strong levels, but jobless claims remain elevated, COVID cases continue to rise, and progress on a fiscal relief bill is uncertain. All of these factors will be on the minds of the FOMC as they meet today.$$$$The dollar had already fallen to fresh two-year lows this morning. Europe’s strong PMI prints sent EUR/USD to new highs. There was a muted reaction in the dollar index following the mixedPMI prints. Since March, the dollar has remained on a long downtrend. Potential further moves in the dollar remain focused around today’s FOMC meeting.$$$$Chart prepared by Izaac Brook; EUR/USD on Tradingview.$$$$--- Written by Izaac Brook of DailyFX.com.
DAX 30 Heading Higher Despite German Lockdown, EUR/USD Unfazed by ECB	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/12/14/DAX-30-Heading-Higher-Despite-German-Lockdown-EURUSD-Unfazed-by-ECB.html	1607936400	Brexit and US stimulus talks remain at the center of market sentiment.$$$$Germany will enter a hard lockdown on Wednesday, DAX 30 springs back from 13,000.$$$$EUR/USD aims towards 2.5 year high.	A rising rate of infections and exponential growth in the last few days is the reason why Germany will be entering a full lockdown from Wednesday, with all schools and shops closed until the 10th of January. This will affect the Christmas period, a decision made as authorities were “forced to act” Angela Merkel said, after Friday almost 30,000 infections and 598 deaths in Germany.$$$$This move comes after a softer lockdown imposed at the beginning of November has bared fruit up until people started to meet friends and relatives ahead of the Christmas holiday. Under new rules, private gatherings of more than 5 people will be banned, and new year’s eve celebrations have been strongly discouraged.$$$$Stock Market Holiday Calendar 2020/21.$$$$In equity markets, sentiment has become more positive as there seems to be some progress on two major political fronts. On the one hand, Brexit talks are set to continue this week after Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen had set yesterday as the deadline to determine the future of talks. Meanwhile, US stimulus talks seem to be going in the right direction with some analysts expecting there to be a bipartisan compromise that will lead to a deal in the next few days.$$$$There is also increased talks about whether we will see a Santa Rally this year, which tends to see stocks rise around 1,5% in the last few trading days of December, leading into the first two sessions of the new year. But there is a strong argument that stocks are massively overbought this year, pushing along from the positive vaccine news in November, so a Santa Rally could be far-fetched. $$$$That said, seasonal trends tend to be quite strong, and positive momentum on the expected improvement of the health situation given a vaccine roll-out might keep stocks heading higher in the new year. $$$$DAX 30 Daily chart.$$$$Looking at the daily chart, the DAX 30 confirmed strong support at the 13,000 level as I mentioned last week, after Friday’s bearish rally was met with strong buying pressure at that level. This is likely going to continue going forward, as we need to see a stronger bearish case to consider further retracement towards the 12,500 area. $$$$Consolidation is still not out of the picture, as price action heads back towards the area where it was trading the last two weeks. To break sideways trading we would need to see a continued push above 13,400, gearing up to face the 10-month high seen last Wednesday at 13,458. Momentum indicators are showing mixed signals, with the stochastic resetting around the 35 level, whilst the MACD becomes slightly more negative, which could point to this short-term indecision with regards to direction in the DAX 30.$$$$4 days after the ECB’s attempt to soften the euro’s recent strength, EUR/USD is nearing two-year highs again on renewed positivism regarding US stimulus and Brexit, which is keeping risk-appetite afloat. The US Dollar is trading lower today as an attempt to recover some ground saw a bullish rejection at the 91.00 mark, which is keeping EUR/USD supported at the 1.21 area. $$$$The ascending trendline from the higher lows since the 4th of November remains as a strong support area in the short-term, meaning that 1.2085 is the immediate support, followed by last week’s low at 1.2060, from which point a fall below 1.20 becomes a real threat. On the upside, a daily close above 1.2160 could gather enough bullish momentum to break the two-and-a-half-year high at 1.2177, with the 1.22 line as the next objective. $$$$EUR/USD Daily chart.$$$$Learn more about the stock market basics here or download our free trading guides. $$$$--- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Market Analyst.$$$$Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin.

Talks between the EU and UK are seemingly going nowhere and both sides are now saying that this Sunday remains the crunch day as to whether post-Brexit trade talks will continue or not. Both parties are now saying that a no-deal seems the more likely outcome, leaving Sterling, and to a certain extent the Euro, at risk of further weakness. This EUR and GBP weakness will likely boost the US dollar basket (DXY) as investors return to the haven USD, underpinning a currently weak greenback. $$$$.  $$$$The latest ECB meeting produced little new or unexpected news with the central bank increasing its bond-buying program by a further EUR500 billion and extending it out to March 2022, all in line with market expectations. ECB President Lagarde continues to keep monetary policy as loose as possible as Europe struggles with an increase in Covid-19 cases and stagnating growth. While Eurozone government yields have been uber-low or negative for some time now, the yield on the Spanish 10-year turned negative Thursday for the first, while Greek 10-years now offer a record low of just 57 basis points of yield.$$$$The daily EURUSD chart shows the pair stagnating near recent highs but with little enthusiasm to push further ahead. All three simple moving averages are positive, underpinning the recent move higher, while the CCI indicator shows that the pair are no longer in overbought territory. The outcome of Brexit talks and next week’s FOMC meeting will drive EUR/USD price action into the end of December and beyond.  $$$$IG Retail trader data show 31.18% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 2.21 to 1. We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.Positioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week.

Euro Strengthens on PMIs, EUR/USD, EUR/GBP Levels to Watch	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/12/16/Euro-Strengthens-on-PMIs-EURUSD-EURGBP-Levels-to-Watch.html	1608110160	Euro boosted on better than expected PMI data.$$$$EUR/USD, EUR/GBP levels to watch.	Despite the euro not needing an extra push to consolidate its upward trajectory, the release of PMI figures this morning helped the European currency garnish further bullish momentum needed to clear some hurdles. First came French and German data, both seeing a significant boost in the services sector after both countries have recently come out of strict lockdowns during the month of November. That said, the health crisis seems to be getting worse before it gets better, and these optimistic readings could easily fade away if social restriction measures remain much longer. The overall figure for Eurozone was again much better than expected both in services and manufacturing, keeping momentum going in the euro. Despite the December data being better than expected, all three readings continue to be in the contraction area for services.$$$$Source: Refinitiv.$$$$EUR/USD: continued upside pressure in the pair as it surpassed the 1.2150 level. Downside support remains in the rising trendline from connecting the higher lows since November 4th, now at 1.2115. A break below this level opens the door for a retracement towards 1.20. On the upside, the pair has pushed above 1.2177 (last week’s high) managing to break 1.22 for the first time since April 2018, but it is likely to face some challenge to hold above this level. As we approach the Federal Reserve meeting this afternoon, we could see the pair pull back slightly ahead of the meeting and this could lead to a “buy the dips” scenario. $$$$EUR/USDDaily Chart.$$$$EUR/GBP: the pair continues to be highly volatile on the back of continue Brexit headlines as we near the deadline for a trade deal. The path of least resistance seems to be firmly lower at this moment, after reaching a 3-month high on Friday on the back of a failed meeting between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen. Commitment from both sides to continue talks has seen the pair head firmly towards the 0.90 line, where the 50-day SMA is starting to converge below the 200-day SMA, a sign that further weakness can be expected. The upside is capped at the 23.6% Fibonacci (0.9223) whilst an increase of selling pressure is expected around the 0.91 line. To the downside, a break below 0.8983 will open the door for further weakness towards the unbreakable support since May 15th at 0.8863.$$$$EUR/GBP Daily chart.$$$$--- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Market Analyst.$$$$Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin.

EUR/USD, EURGBP Price Analysis & News.$$$$A mixed set of PMI figures from France and Germany sees are fairly muted reaction in the Euro. To little surprise, the services sector took a significant hit given that the data covered the second lockdown. However, this was slightly above expectations, while IHS Markit noted that the latest contraction in activity was substantially slower than the previous lockdown, given that firms were able to better adapt to lockdown, thus less vulnerable to sharp falls in activity. French manufacturing sector slipped into contractionary territory, against expectations for a slight expansion of 50.1. Elsewhere, German PMI figures were broadly positive with both the manufacturing and composite reading surprising to the upside, thus the Euro and European indices have held steady.$$$$Source: Refinitiv.$$$$EUR/USD: A narrow range thus far in the pair, although with a softer USD trend persisting, topside resistance is in focus at 1.1880-90 (last week’s highs). A break above opens the door to 1.1920. On the door, support is situated at 1.1815-20 where failure to hold puts the pair on course for a move towards 1.1750. $$$$EUR/GBP: The cross firmly lower to kick off the week as markets digest UK press reports that PM Johnson prepares significant Brexit intervention as negotiators begin the final push. As such, the cross will remain headline focused throughout the week. That said, in the event of a deal, a move to 0.8700 is likely on the cards for the cross.

Imports rose by 9.1%.$$$$The latest German IFO figures also beat forecasts but remained below levels seen last month due to the latest round of Covid-19 restrictions.  $$$$EUR/USD nudged slightly higher after the German GDP release earlier in the session and benefitted from a small sell-off in the US dollar. The greenback rallied sharply on Monday afternoon after the flash November Markit PMI jumped to 56.7, beating expectations of 53.0 and the prior month’s reading of 53.4. After having traded above 1.1900 in the morning, the pair fell sharply post-PMI release, making a low of just under 1.1800. The pair currently trades around 1.1875, boosted by today’s German GDP release and a marginally weaker US dollar, but may find difficulty in breaking above an area of resistance back up to 1.19175.

The US Dollar is surging while major stock indices like the Dow Jones push higher in immediate response to flash PMI data just released by IHS Markit for November. The monthly PMI report crushed market forecast for both manufacturing and services sector components, which propelled the headline composite index reading to 57.9 and a five-plus year high. $$$$Chart Source: DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$This sparked a huge reversal lower by EUR/USD with spot prices sinking over 70-pips in response to the move. US Dollar strength looks broad-based as USD price action gains across major currency pairs. Likewise, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq extended higher following better-than-expected PMI data release after gaining modestly at the New York opening bell. $$$$Gold prices fell sharply while the DXY Index and Treasury yields advanced. A notable uptick in business activity and employment detailed in the latest US PMI report likely provides traders with reasons to be optimistic on the United States - particularly in light of less encouraging PMIs out of the Eurozone. $$$$EUR/USD price action now trades down about 0.3% intraday and around the 1.1820-level, which roughly aligns with last week’s low. Failing to hold this potential technical support level could see EUR/USD selling pressure accelerate toward the mid-point retracement of its month-to-date range near the 1.1760-mark. $$$$That all said, it is also worth mentioning that the ongoing influx of US Dollar demand is likely being exacerbated by a squeeze as EUR/USD longs unwind their positions after being caught offsides headed into the Thanksgiving holiday and month-end. Furthermore, robust US economic data could downplay the urgency of another fiscal stimulus package or additional accommodation from the Federal Reserve, which could provide bullish tailwinds to the US Dollar and bearish headwinds to equities. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

USD price action is trading notably weaker on Tuesday as measured by the US Dollar Index. The DXY, a basket of major currency pairs heavily weighted toward EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY, is down about 0.3% following the New York opening bell. US Dollar selling pressure has mounted over the last few trading sessions and caused the DXY Index to slide back toward a critical technical support level near the 92.00-price level. Breaching this important area of buoyancy has potential to open up the door to additional downside. $$$$Chart by @RichDvorakFX created using TradingView.$$$$One fundamental driver helping keep the broader US Dollar afloat likely includes rising Treasury yields. That said, the ten-year US Treasury yield has declined by about 12-basis points to 0.87% after failing to take out the psychologically-significant 1.00% level last week. In light of surging COVID-19 cases and escalating restrictions on activity, lingering demand for safe-haven assets such as US Treasuries could explain the downward pressure on Treasury yields. $$$$Further, the Federal Reserve has hinted at the possibility of more dovish measures, which poses a headwind to USD price action. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that the FOMC might need to tweak its asset purchase program and provide more monetary support to the economy after worse-than-expected US retail sales data crossed market wires this morning. $$$$This could keep a lid on long-term US Treasury yields and encourage USD bears to maintain selling pressure. Nevertheless, with risk aversion seemingly creeping back into the market, there is potential that the US Dollar finds a bid due to its posturing as a top safe-haven currency. To that end, the US Dollar is currently trading higher relative to the sentiment-linked Australian Dollar. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

The German ZEW economic sentiment reading for November has once again taken a sharp decline, plummeting 17.1 points to 39.0, according to the latest report. According to ZEW President Professor Achim Wambach, “Financial experts are concerned about the economic impact of the second wave of COVID-19 and what this will entail. The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment has therefore once again significantly decreased in November, indicating a slowdown of economic recovery in Germany. There is also the additional worry that the German economy could head back into recession’.$$$$The single fell back to 1.1800 after the ZEW survey was released. The US dollar has picked up a small bid, helped in part by higher US Treasury yields, and a risk-on tone across the market, driven by Joe Biden’s presidential victory and positive coronavirus drug news.

EUR/USD, USD/JPY Outlook: Narrative Tug of War Between COVID Vaccine and COVID Cases	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/11/12/EURUSD-USDJPY-Outlook-Narrative-Tug-of-War-Between-COVID-Vaccine-and-COVID-Cases.html	1605183300	Vaccine Hopes vs COVID Concerns.$$$$EUR/USD Tracks Higher on Cross-Related EUR/GBP Buying.$$$$JPY Recovers Slightly.$$$$USD/JPY Risks on the Upside Amid Higher Yields and Equities.	The tug of war between vaccine optimism and COVID concerns as to what is the more dominant narrative sees major FX pairs in limbo. Besides some modest firming in the Euro the rest of the G10 have been trading relatively flat. Pfizer’s vaccine breakthrough has raised hopes that others may see similar results, most notably Moderna, who stated yesterday that it has enough data for a first interim analysis of COVID vaccine. While the company has not given an exact time as to when the results will be released, Dr Fauci has said however, that the data could be announced within the next couple of days. To that end, market sensitivity to further vaccine updates is likely to remain high amid hopes of a quicker distribution of a COVID vaccine from several providers. $$$$FX Majors 1-Day % Change.$$$$EUR: Broad based gains for the Euro, with EUR/USD supported by cross-related flows in EUR/GBP. Topside resistance in the EUR/USD sits at 1.1820-25, where a break above opens the door to 1.1870-75. Failure to overcome initial resistance puts focus back on 1.1755-60. Elsewhere, declines in EUR/GBP had been curbed at the September lows with the cross back in the mid-89s While a deal can see the cross return to 0.87, with current negotiations set to miss yet another deadline (Nov 15th) uncertainties do still remain for GBP and thus the bounce back better reflects those risks. My bias remains a fade on EUR/GBP rallies.$$$$EUR/USD Option expiries: 1.1740-45 (550M), 1.1765 (687M), 1.1795-1.1805 (1.3BLN), 1.1825-30 (750M)$$$$EUR/GBP Pivots - Support: 0.8870, 0.8834, 0.8810. Resistance: 0.8930, 0.8954, 0.8979.$$$$Source: Refinitiv.$$$$JPY: A slight recovery in the Japanese Yen as US yields ease off a touch (10yrs down 4bps), while a slightly softer risk tone also sees cross-yen edge lower. That said, following the announcement of vaccine breakthrough, risks are tilted to Yen selling. Keep in mind, that market positioning had been on the long JPY side to hedge against election risks, according to CFTC data. Therefore, with only a short period time for USD/JPY below 104.00, JPY will remain vulnerable to a further correction particularly as US yields and the Nikkei 225 remains elevated, the latter trading at a multi-decade high. Alongside this, with notable topside options at the 109.00 strike, I wouldn’t rule out a move for USD/JPY to extend towards those levels. $$$$Source: Refinitiv.
Euro Forecast: EUR/USD Rangebound, EUR/GBP Pushes Lower	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/11/18/EURUSD-EURGBP.html	1605700800	Euro Taking a Blind Eye to Near-Term Risks.$$$$Lower No-Deal Risks Pushes EUR/GBP Lower.	EUR/USD, EUR/GBP Price Analysis & News.$$$$The Euro has continued to grind higher with a softer USD largely dictating price action. This is despite apparent near-term concerns with regard to rising COVID cases and renewed slowing of major economies. More specifically, Poland and Hungary have vetoed further progress regarding the EU’s Budget and Recovery Fund in response to the rule of law. However, the Euro appears to have taken a blind eye to this, with the market view being that a compromise is likely to be reached before the first disbursements, which had been touted for mid-2021. $$$$EUR/USD: A gentle move higher for the Euro as it approaches 1.19, however, the key level on the topside is at 1.1920 (last week’s high), where a break renews interest towards a 1.20 test. That said, with the narrative tug of war persisting between a “worse before it gets better COVID outlook” in the near-term and a “2021 looking less like 2020 view “ on the back of recent vaccine developments, there has broadly been a lack of conviction in EUR/USD with the pair remaining somewhat rangebound. Given the charge higher in the equity space amid recent vaccine announcements, much of the good news looks to have been priced in for now, so I’m biased to a more defensive view. Although, while the likes of traditional safe-havens such as the Japanese Yen has firmed, the USD has continued to struggle. $$$$EUR/USD Chart: Hourly Timeframe.$$$$Source: Refinitiv.$$$$EUR/GBP: An EU-UK trade deal is not a question of if, it is a question of when. Press reports this week have hinted that a deal could be imminent after the Sun highlighted that the EU could offer the UK a deal next week. Alongside this, encouraging reports from the Telegraph overnight stated that France are willing to accept that their fishing industry will have less rights. However, while the mood music has been positive, there had still been some pushback from the UK, who signalled otherwise that a deal was imminent, raising the possibility that negotiations could stretch out into the first two weeks of next month. $$$$While a deal will undoubtfully be positive for GBP, the question is how far will it go given that the market base case is for a deal to happen with a Bloomberg survey showing that 70% expected a trade deal, while BoE’s Ramsden attached a 20% likelihood of a no-deal. In the DailyFX weekly GBP forecast this had highlighted that markets were pricing out no-deal risks. With that in mind, the key area for EUR/GBP will be 0.87. In the short term, resistance resides at 0.9000 and 0.9020 above, while the downside, initial support sits at 0.8937 (200DMA) with 0.8900 and 0.8860 below.$$$$EUR/GBP Chart: Daily Timeframe.$$$$Source: Refinitiv.

The US dollar basket (DXY) is paring some recent gains and trades nearly 0.50% lower at 93.60 after making a five-week high yesterday. Technical support remains close off the 20- and 50-day simple moving averages but with volatility expected to rise as the election results hit the screens, support and resistance levels may be broken with ease.$$$$EUR/USD is stalling around 1.1700 and any push above here will meet with further areas of resistance, with the 20- and 50-day simple moving averages seen between 1.1750 and 1.1763. The CCI indicator suggested that EURUSD was oversold recently, so today’s move, driven by US dollar weakness, maybe balancing out this market set-up.$$$$The Euro as a currency will likely find it difficult to appreciate in its own right over the next few weeks and months. The recent second round of coronavirus lockdowns in Europe has sparked concern that Q4 GDP figures for the single-block will be a lot weaker than expected with some banks now seeing negative growth at the end of the year. The ECB has already stated that it will do whatever is needed with whatever tool/s that are appropriate with the December central bank meeting the starting point for the next round of monetary stimulus. $$$$IG Retail trader datashow53.93% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.17 to 1.The number of traders net-long is 18.90% higher than yesterday and 57.52% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 11.39% lower than yesterday and 39.99% lower from last week.We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to fall.$$$$Traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger EUR/USD-bearish contrarian trading bias.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

Eurozone Q3 GDP printed at 12.7% exceeding expectations of 9.4%, however, remains 4.3% below 2019 levels last year. The higher than expected figure had come as little surprise with ECB President Lagarde stating as much in yesterday’s press conference. For that reason as well as the fact that the momentum in growth is expected to have slowed dramatically in Q4 amid renewed lockdown measures, the Euro had been unmoved following the release. The bigger focus for the Euro in the short term being placed on the Q4 growth outlook, alongside next week’s US election. $$$$In light of the Eurozone’s growth trajectory taking a sharp turn for the worse, the ECB President sent out a strong message that the central bank will throw the kitchen sink once again to combat the impact from a second COVID wave. Lagarde noted that they will recalibrate all instruments, suggesting that another stimulus package will not just be limited to PEPP. ECB sources later noted that the governing council had discussed recalibrating PEPP, alongside TLTROs.$$$$EUR/USD: Risks remain tilted to the downside for the Euro with the 1.16 handle quickly approaching, thus ahead of the election the Euro is vulnerable to another leg lower as Euro longs continue to head for the exit. Elsewhere, with investment bank month-end signals now touting USD strength from earlier in the week looking for USD weakness, eyes will be on near-term support at 1.1630 before 1.1600-10. On the topside, resistance sits at 1.17.$$$$EUR/JPY: The grind lower has shown little signs of easing, in turn, raising the risk of an extended move towards support at 121.14, which marks the 200DMA.

However, even the Federal Reserve has suggested that additional stimulus may be required for a swift economic recovery to be possible.$$$$Meanwhile, the second wave of the Coronavirus outbreak in Europe has raised concerns, as France and Spain have reported the largest number of new cases since April, reiterating the fact that the pandemic is far from over. So far, the ECB appears to be adopting a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy with the Governing Council insisting that the EUR 1.350 trillion envelope for the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) “should be considered a ceiling rather than a target.” In addition to this, the Brexit deadline is fast approaching, and details surrounding a Deal are still unknown. The upcoming ECB minutes may shed more light on the council’s thinking.$$$$DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$Currently, the four chart below highlights how the Fibonacci retracement (taken from the 16 July low to the 1 September high) has continued to provide support and resistance for the major currency pair. This confluent zone has kept both bulls and bears at bay, just short of the psychological level of 1.18.$$$$However, the 50-period Moving Average has provided additional support for the EUR/USD, while the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence remains above the zero-line, a possible indication that the pair may still be considered overbought, at least in the short-term.$$$$EUR/USD Four Hour Chart $$$$Chart prepared by Tammy Da Costa, IG.$$$$For now, the psychological level of 1.18 continues to hold as resistance. A break above this level could see the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level forming resistance at 1.18604.$$$$Contrary to this, support is provided by the moving average at a level of 1.173 with the next support level forming at the 50% retracement level at 1.16916.$$$$IGCS shows that, at the time of writing, 65% of retail traders are holding short positions in the EUR/USD.

That said, while overall short positioning in the greenback remains large, as global macro uncertainties rise in relation to the US election as well as second wave concerns and subsequent renewed lockdown measures, safe-haven flows will underpin the greenback, thus allowing for a further squeeze in USD shorts.$$$$Speculators flipped to net short in the Pound following a $1.26bln reduction in net longs, accounting for roughly a third of the positioning change in the US Dollar. Both the EU and UK have yet to make enough headway to solve significant differences in key areas such as fisheries and state aid. However, with the markets remaining hopeful that a Brexit agreement can be reached, this has prevented a free-fall in the Pound. That said, as funds begin to shed their net longs, the Pound is likely to remain erratic with headline risk heightened.$$$$Long exposure in the Australian Dollar had been halved after hitting over a 2yr peak. However, as uncertainty tracks higher, with the market still long Aussie, the high-beta currency remains vulnerable to pullbacks. Alongside this, near-term concerns also centre around the RBA rate decision, where there is an outside chance of a dovish surprise with a 15bps cut in the cash rate target, alongside this 3yr yield curve target and Term Funding Facility. $$$$US Dollar  | $$$$EUR/USD | $$$$GBP/USD | $$$$USD/JPY | $$$$USD/CHF | $$$$USD/CAD | $$$$AUD/USD | $$$$NZD/USD | $$$$For a more in-depth analysis on FX, check out the FX Forecast

USD Price Outlook: US Dollar Mired by Fiscal Stimulus Deadline	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/10/19/usd-price-outlook-us-dollar-mired-by-fiscal-stimulus-deadline.html	1603137600	US Dollar dropped about 0.5% early Monday as measured by the broad-based DXY Index.$$$$USD price action still seems fixated on lingering uncertainty around fiscal stimulus talks.$$$$The Pound-Dollar is expected to be the most volatile major currency pair this week.	Fiscal stimulus negotiations continue to largely drive the direction of the US Dollar. The DXY Index declined around half a percent during Monday’s trading session with FX traders still seeming optimistic that US politicians can agree on another coronavirus aid package before the upcoming election. $$$$Over the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi placed a 48-hour deadline for the Trump Administration to reconcile their $1.8-trillion package proposal with the $2.2-trillion stimulus bill laid out by Democrats. Senate Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to call for a vote on a targeted stimulus deal that carries a much lower price tag at around $500-billion. $$$$Chart by @RichDvorakFX created using TradingView.$$$$The prospect of more fiscal firepower to counter the coronavirus pandemic’s toll on the US economy is a primary driver of recent USD selling pressure. That said, uncertainty surrounding the likelihood that House Democrats and Senate Republicans can set aside their political differences to agree on another stimulus deal has contributed materially to US Dollar volatility. Discrepancies largely remain over the amount of fiscal funding to provide to state and local governments. Failure to reach a deal before the two-day deadline imposed by Speaker Pelosi opens up the door to potential for a big breakdown in stimulus negotiations, which would likely stand to send the US Dollar exploding higher and stocks swooning lower into the November 2020 election.$$$$Meanwhile, the broader DXY Index still gravitates around a critical level of technical confluence underpinned by its 50-day simple moving average. USD price action also looks coiled between two conflicting trendlines: a short-term bearish trend identified by the lower highs recorded on 25 September and 15 October juxtaposed with a medium-term bullish trend developing from higher lows printed on 31 August and 12 October. A break below the ascending trendline could tee-up a quick move toward technical support highlighted by the 92.75-price level whereas a break above the descending trendline might motivate US Dollar bulls to target the 94.00-handle and September swing highs. $$$$Key FX counterparts to the US Dollar - such as the EUR and GBP - have also contributed to recent Greenback turbulence. EUR/USD and GBP/USD comprise 57.6% and 11.9% of the DXY Index respectively and thus tend to weigh notably on the broader US Dollar. As new COVID-19 cases climb and restrictions on business activity are reimplemented across the Eurozone and UK, mounting coronavirus concerns might exacerbate potential US Dollar strength given its status as a top safe-haven currency. $$$$Not to mention, the Pound-Dollar remains exposed to ongoing Brexit drama as well. GBP/USD is estimated to be the most active major currency pair this week according to one-week implied volatility readings clocked as of Friday’s close. Options-implied trading ranges are calculated using 1-standard deviation (i.e. 68% statistical probability price action is contained within the implied trading range over the specified time frame).$$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

US Dollar Firms on Solid PMI Data as Stimulus Hope Fades	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/10/23/us-dollar-firms-on-solid-pmi-data-as-stimulus-hopes-fade.html	1603461600	US Dollar attempts to claw back lost ground and turn positive on the day following PMI data.$$$$An uptick in US Dollar strength looks most notable against the EUR, CAD, and AUD.$$$$A breakdown in fiscal stimulus negotiations could exacerbate USD buying pressure.	The US Dollar is perking up during Friday trade shortly after the New York opening bell. An overall solid PMI report just released by IHS Markit looks like a potential driver of returning US Dollar strength. Although the manufacturing component slightly missed market consensus, it still improved sequentially, and business activity across the services sector showed a marked gain for October. This likely boosts US economic growth trajectory on the back of solid momentum headed into 4Q-2020.$$$$Chart Source: DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$The Markit PMI report for October highlighted how business confidence increased notably for both manufacturing and service sectors. Although, optimism was said to stem from firms becoming “increasingly positive about prospects for the coming year amid hopes for renewed stimulus, COVID-19 containment measures gradually easing, and greater certainty for businesses and households after the presidential election.”$$$$Chart by @RichDvorakFX created using TradingView.$$$$That said, the latest fiscal stimulus headlines from key US politicians seem to have poured cold water on expectations for a stimulus deal before the November 2020 election. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow stated that “the ball is not moving much on stimulus relief” this morning, which is a less-hopeful tone than conveyed previously. $$$$This likely stands as a larger driver of the US Dollar’s intraday advance off session lows, which could continue while odds of a comprehensive aid package passing congress before the election quickly dwindle. US Dollar perkiness this morning following the stimulus headlines and Markit PMI data looks most notable across EUR/USD, USD/CAD, and AUD/USD. $$$$Keep Reading: US Dollar (USD) Presidential Election Performance May Prove Anything but Typical.$$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

This week has seen a remarkably firm Euro as markets continued to price in a democrat sweep, which has largely been characterised by short USD trades. However, aside from the US election, factors that had supported the Euro have begun to the fade with headwinds facing the currency beginning to rise. That said, this hasn’t entirely been reflected in the price with the Euro trading at 1-month highs. $$$$Interest rate differentials have been moving in favour of the USD since August with the 10yr spread widening more aggressively since the back end of September. Alongside this, as inflation risks for the Eurozone remain heavily tilted to the downside, expectations are being built in the that the ECB could look for a fresh round of stimulus by the end of the year. As such, focus will be on next week’s ECB meeting, which may lay the groundwork for policy action in December. $$$$Source: Refinitiv.$$$$Second wave of COVID cases across Europe is evident with several countries forced to renew lockdown measures, thus growth differentials look to also move in favour of the US over the Eurozone. In turn, tomorrow’s PMI readings will be of interest as they will take into account lockdown measures that have taken place in October. That said, the Euro looks to be trading at slightly rich levels against its major counterparts and thus remains vulnerable to set backs. $$$$EUR/USD: A factor behind the notable support for the Euro has been the Chinese Yuan going from strength to strength, as such, a slowing in the appreciation of the Yuan can be enough to curtail upside in the Euro. On the topside, resistance resides at 1.1900-15, where a break above opens the door to 1.1940-50. Initial support sits at 1.1830 (Oct 9th peak) with a move below opening the doors to 1.1790-1.1800. Sizeable option expiries between 1.1800-1.1900 could see the spot price remain within this range.$$$$EUR/JPY: In light of the factors mentioned above, risks appear tilted to the downside in the cross with a move towards 123.00 on the cards. Once again the 50DMA (124.62) held firm after another failed attempt at piercing through, which in turn puts the focus on the 100DMA at 123.50. Below the 100DMA exposes psychological support at 123.00, marking the Oct 2nd and 15th bottom.$$$$10 Most Popular Candlestick Patterns.

Visit the DailyFX Educational Center to discover why news events are Key to Forex Fundamental Analysis.$$$$With less than a week before the much anticipated US presidential elections, risk sentiment shifted as Europe announced fresh lockdown restrictions throughout the Eurozone, increasing demand for the USD and other safe-haven currencies. With the economy already on a downward trajectory, hopes of a swift economic recovery have diminished as the number of Covid-19 cases continue to increase at an alarming rate, reiterating the fact that the pandemic is far from over. This puts an immense amount on pressure on the European Central Bank as Christine Lagarde sets the tone in today’s ECB meeting. Although the wait and see approach is expected to hold for now, any hints of future policy amendments may affect the direction of the Euro for the foreseeable future.$$$$Meanwhile, there are a number of high impact economic events that are likely to be additional drivers for price action for the major currency pair, including the release of US Q3 GDP data today, followed by Eurozone inflation and GDP figures tomorrow.$$$$DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$From a technical standpoint, the EUR/USD weekly chart below highlights how price action has remained faithful to the Fibonacci retracement levels (between Jan 2017 low and Feb 2018 high), providing support and resistance for the pair.  $$$$EUR/USD Weekly Chart.$$$$Chart prepared by Tammy Da Costa, IG.$$$$Since recovering from March 2020 lows, the daily chart now shows how the Fibonacci retracement has formed areas of confluency, with recent price action trading in a range bound state.

The risk-off tone seen in yesterday’s session had seen firm demand in the dollar index as renewed COVID concerns dampened sentiment. In turn, the Euro had been on the backfoot testing support at the 1.1800. Among the key drivers behind the recovery in the Euro has begun to fade with the growth outlook moving in favour of the US over the Eurozone with the latter being hampered by fresh lockdown measures to curb the second wave of COVID cases. Alongside this, the Chinese Yuan is also seeing more two way risks with the PBoC cutting the Yuan fix to slow down the currency’s appreciation, which in turn has also put some pressure on the Euro. $$$$The ECB will be in focus for the Euro this week and with the outlook deteriorating for the Eurozone, there is rising expectations that ECB’s Lagarde will signal the need for addition monetary policy meeting at its December meeting. As it stands, Bloomberg estimates are for an additional EUR 500bln to its stimulus programme, which can be extended until the end of next year. $$$$EUR/USD: Near-term supports resides at 1.1795-1.1800, which also coincides with the 55DMA. A break below, leaves the door open to 1.1750, while on the topside, resistance sits at 1.1835-40 before 1.1850.

France is considering a new one-month national lockdown if reports are to be believed, while Germany is mulling additional measures – described as ‘lockdown light’ by one newspaper - to prevent the surge of new coronavirus cases across Europe. New cases in both countries, and across Europe, are spiking higher and there are fears that the spread of the virus is becoming impossible to control. A French government spokesman warned that the health system is coming under pressure and that intensive care units could soon hit a ‘level of extreme saturation’ by mid-November.$$$$European equity markets have taken the hit from the increased coronavirus fears over the last few days and now the Euro is starting to wilt against a range of currencies. This new spike in coronavirus cases comes as the latest ECB monetary policy decisions and press conference hove into view tomorrow. The central bank is already under pressure to give the market a further dovish hint at the meeting to help steady the economy, and the latest virus news may force their hand further. While no balance sheet action is expected tomorrow, a clear indication of a further expansion of the PSPP securities lending program in December is becoming more likely.$$$$EUR/USD is back below 1.1800 and is nearing short-term support. The trendline off the late-September double low has held on three occasions and is currently being tested around the 1.1745 level. The pair have also broken below both the 20- and 50-day simple moving averages but have yet to confirm this move.

IG client sentiment data, which track the positioning of IG’s mostly retail clients, are sending out a positive contrarian signal for the USD against the Euro ahead of the results of the US elections, but a negative signal for the broad S&P 500 index of US stock prices.$$$$At DailyFX we typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, so if most traders are long an asset and their long positions are rising we see that as a negative signal – and vice versa. At the time of writing, just ahead of the elections, the figures suggest a bullish contrarian trading bias for the USD against the Euro but mixed signals for many of the other major USD pairs.$$$$Looking at EUR/USD, the data show 53.93% of traders are net-long, with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.17 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 18.90% higher than yesterday and 57.52% higher than last week, while the number of traders net-short is 11.39% lower than yesterday and 39.99% lower than last week.$$$$From a contrarian perspective, the fact traders are net-long suggests EUR/USD may fall. Moreover, traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger EUR/USD-bearish contrarian trading bias.$$$$Source: DailyFX (You can click on it for a larger image)$$$$The IG client sentiment data contrast with the latest figures from the Commitments of Traders report from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which track the larger players in the market but are less up-to-date. These show that in the week to October 27 speculators continued to unwind their bearish positioning in the US Dollar as net shorts were cut by $1billion against G10 currencies. Most of this positioning change was tied to a cut back in Euro net longs ($1.5billion), which are now at their lowest since late July.$$$$Euro aside, the IG data are also sending positive signals for the USD against the Swiss Franc and the New Zealand Dollar and neutral signals for the USD against the Australian Dollar, the British Pound and the Japanese Yen. The only negative signal for the US Dollar is against the Canadian Dollar.$$$$As for the S&P 500, the data show 45.28% of traders are net-long, with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.21 to 1.

An election that is too close to call has seen a modest rise in the US Dollar with Trump performing significantly better than what polls had predicted. However, the toing and froing between who is leading the race has prevented an aggressive bid in the US Dollar. All eyes now focus on Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. As it stands, results for Pennsylvania could take as long as Friday, while Wisconsin may be announced later today with Michigan taking a couple of days. That said, with Biden showing a slight lead in Wisconsin the race is currently neck and neck among bookmakers. $$$$US Election What Happens Next.$$$$EUR/USD: Markets remain choppy and while yesterday’s blue wave trade characterised by USD selling has been unwound, the Euro has managed to claw back some gains into the European session to trade slightly below the 1.17 handle. Expect the pair to continue to trade broadly sideways until the election results become clearer. Short term resistance situated at 1.1700 with a break above opening the doors to 1.1750.$$$$GBP/USD: Much like the rest of G10 FX, cable has whipsawed amid the uncertain election outcome. Elsewhere, Brexit headlines appeared more optimistic with reports of progress being made. However, Brexit noise has largely played second fiddle to the US election in GBP/USD and thus, EUR/GBP is perhaps worth keeping an eye on for GBP strength, which had made a firm break below 0.90. The bias for EUR/GBP remains a fade on rallies.

Strong Euro.$$$$A soaring Euro has captured the eye of ECB chief Christine Lagarde who has revealed the ECB is aware of the ascent and will monitor the pair cautiously. Although the ECB is unlikely to intervene based on past actions, there may be some form of verbal communication that may affect Euro crosses.$$$$2. Low inflation.$$$$Low inflation figures may point to a sustained dovish outlook by the ECB.

US Dollar Price Outlook - Bullish Signal Appears Ahead of High Importance US Data Releases	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/09/03/US-Dollar-Price-Outlook-Bullish-Signal-Appears-Ahead-of-High-Importance-US-Data-Releases.html	1599136200	Euro weakness is helping the DXY to stabilize at lower levels.  $$$$Monthly US Labor Report (NFPs) released on Friday.	The recent move higher in the US dollar basket, off a 27-month low, needs to play out further to gain more credibility as Euro weakness seems to be the short-term driver of price action. The US dollar basket is a measure of value against a basket of six other currencies, including the Euro which has a dominant weighting of 57.6%. Any change in the Euro, therefore, weighs more heavily on DXY price action, as can be seen this week when a sudden dip in the value of the single currency has allowed the US dollar basket to move higher. While the Euro remains weak, helped by ECB commentary questioning the single currency’s strength, the USD is running into a batch of important economic releases that may provide fresh domestic drivers. $$$$In addition, recent CoT data shows that speculative accounts are extremely long of EUR/USD (83%), with short positions being pared back while long positions have been increased. This week’s sharp move lower in EUR/USD is likely to be sellers pushing the exit door open.$$$$The US economic calendar is packed full of potentially market-moving data and events for the rest of the week. Today sees initial jobless claims (12:30 GMT), US ISM (14:00 GMT) and a speech by the Fed’s Charles Evans, while on Friday the monthly US Labor Report – NFPs – are released at 12:30 GMT.

With just eight weeks left before US elections, US-China tensions continue to rise, and with pressure mounting on many other economies.. Meanwhile, Europe is preparing for a no-deal Brexit and the ECB meeting on Thursday, 10 September 2020 should be an additional driver for price action.$$$$From a technical standpoint, after four consecutive months of gains, the EUR/USD has stumbled with bulls unable to push through the 1.2000 level.

DailyFX Economic Data and Events Calendar.$$$$Thursday’s ECB policy meeting and press conference will likely play an important role in the future direction of the single currency although it may be talk rather than action that sets the tone. The central bank is expected to leave all policy levers untouched but they may indicate that they are unhappy with the current level of the Euro which is dampening price pressures in the single-block. Recent comments from ECB chief economist Philip Lane that the EUR/USD rate ‘does matter’ has seemingly drawn a 1.2000 line in the sand for the pair and this topside is likely to be respected by the market for now. $$$$ECB President Christine Lagarde is likely to highlight that Euro strength is weighing on both growth and inflation outlooks and that the central bank is uncomfortable with the current level of the single currency to a certain degree. The more forcefully President Lagarde makes these comments, the more the Euro will fall, while a less dovish stance will allow the single currency to recoup some of its recent losses.$$$$EUR/USD made a decisive break below the supportive 20-day moving average at the end of last week and is now pressing down on the 50-dma for the first time since late-May when the pair traded just below 1.0900. A break and open below the shorter-dated moving average opens the way to the 1.1696 – 1.1700 area before 1.1650 comes into play. Resistance is seen at 1.1848, off the 20-dma and a pair of short-term prior highs either side of 1.1866. $$$$IG retail trader data shows 42.89% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.33 to 1.The number of traders net-long is 4.49% lower than yesterday and 26.39% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 0.56% higher than yesterday and 7.15% lower from last week.$$$$We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.Positioning is more net-short than yesterday but less net-short from last week.

DailyFX Economic Data and Events Calendar.$$$$Thursday’s ECB policy meeting and press conference saw the central bank marginally upgrade growth expectations and row back on any meaningful attempt to dampen the value of the Euro. President Christine Lagarde said that while the exchange rate was discussed, the ECB would only ‘monitor carefully’ any further moves. Expectations going into the meeting were for the central bank to take a stronger approach to any further Euro appreciation after August’s core inflation fell to 0.4% y/y from 1.2% while the annual headline rate turned negative in August, -0.2% from +0.4% in July. A stronger Euro keeps downward pressure on Eurozone inflation as imports become cheaper and exports more expensive. $$$$Several ECB members are speaking today and their commentary should be closely followed.

EUR/USD Remains Underpinned as German ZEW Sentiment Improves in September	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/09/15/EURUSD-Remains-Underpinned-as-German-ZEW-Sentiment-Improves-in-September.html	1600162320	German Sentiment data improves despite Brexit, COVID fears. $$$$EUR/USD now eyes Wednesday’s FOMC meeting for direction.	The latest look at German sentiment showed the EU’s largest member state pushing ahead despite a worrying background. The Euro area economic sentiment reading also beat expectations in September, adding strength to the recent EUR/USD uptick.$$$$DailyFX Economic Data and Events Calendar.$$$$While the data will be well received by the ECB, one member of the central bank warned today that challenges to growth and inflation remain. ECB executive board member Fabio Panetta was out on the wires earlier today saying the central bank needs to remain vigilant and carefully access incoming data, ‘including exchange rate developments’ in another nod to the importance of the EURUSD exchange rate. Panetta added that while the results achieved by the ECB’s monetary policy measures are ‘remarkable’, they are not ‘fully satisfactory yet’, suggesting that the central bank may have more to do to boost economic growth and inflation. $$$$The recent short-term rally in EUR/USD has seen the pair bounce off the 50-day moving average and open the 20-dma today, adding to bullish sentiment for the pair. A series of higher lows adds further credibility to this positive move. Short-term challenges lie ahead with last Thursday’s 1.1920 print the first level of resistance before a handful of previous highs block the way to 1.2000. This level may well spark further commentary from ECB board members. While the ECB said recently that they are not targeting any exchange rate level, commentary suggests that they are looking at it, and the 1.2000 area, carefully due to the negative effects of the exchange rate on inflation. It is looking likely that EUR/USD upside is capped in the short- to medium-term, especially if further ECB rhetoric looks to dampen the exchange rate. $$$$Wednesday’s FOMC meeting nears and commentary from Fed chair Jerome Powell will be closely monitored. With interest rates in the US likely to stay lower for longer, and with any inflation overshoot set to be ignored in favor of growth, the US dollar may edge lower, adding further upside potential to EUR/USD.$$$$IG Retail trader data shows 39.66% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.52 to 1.The number of traders net-long is 5.73% lower than yesterday and 12.72% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 11.58% higher than yesterday and 5.03% higher from last week.$$$$We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests EUR/USD prices may continue to rise.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

US Dollar Extends Rally as Global PMI Data Fans Volatility	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/09/23/us-dollar-extends-rally-as-global-pmi-data-fans-volatility.html	1600875000	US Dollar pushing higher against major FX peers on the back of global PMI data.$$$$USD price action strengthening sharply off two-year lows points to risk aversion.$$$$EUR/USD could extend its bearish correction as rising volatility boosts the US Dollar 	The Greenback is gaining ground during early Wednesday trade as the US Dollar builds upon its bullish reversal attempt off two-year lows. USD price action is strengthening in the wake of global PMI data just released by IHS Markit, which revealed that business activity across several advanced economies is slumping. Risk aversion in response to the disappointing PMI figures looks to be bidding up the US Dollar due to its posturing as a top safe-haven currency. $$$$According to the DailyFX Economic Calendar, flash US PMI data was little changed month-over-month. The US manufacturing sector improved marginally from 53.1 to 53.5, but the more important services sector component dropped from 55.0 to 54.6 for September. $$$$On a relative basis, US economic activity held up better than its EU counterpart with Eurozone PMI data showing a sharper decline in its composite index to 50.1 from 51.9 reported previously. This divergence between EU and US PMI data, which was first identified right after last month’s PMI data release, stands to fuel broader US Dollar strength. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$The US Dollar Index jumping above the 94.00-price level likely serves as an unnerving technical development for USD bears. This could validate a neckline break of the inverse head and shoulder reversal pattern, which follows the US Dollar reclaiming its 50-day moving average. $$$$From a fundamental perspective, rising market volatility stands out as a primary driver steering USD price action higher. Mounting risk aversion could exacerbate the resurgence of US Dollar strength - particularly if a short squeeze ensues with Euro bulls unwinding their long EUR/USD positions. $$$$That said, the broader US Dollar shows potential to continue climbing with spot EUR/USD price action breaching its critical support zone around the 1.1700-mark. EUR/USD printing lower lows brings to focus its 100-day moving average near the 1.1600-handle as a possible downside objective for US Dollar bulls. This area of technical confluence is also underpinned by its mid-point retracement of the rally from 1.1200 to 1.2000.  $$$$Keep Reading - USD Price Outlook: US Dollar Ripping Higher as Markets Swoon.$$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

EUR/USD is on the brink of breaking support as the US dollar continues to look strong across the board. To get below all significant support price needs to break cleanly through 11695. From there it could drop quickly as it leaves behind the ranging price action. However, it needs to actually break support first – until it does it should be respected as support.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$AUD/USD is also teetering on support, with it barely holding onto a channel. I’ve drawn it in with a couple of slight variations to allow for some wiggle room, but soon regardless of how it’s drawn the structure could be broken. A closing 4-hr candle into the 7160s should prove enough separation for downside momentum to pick up.$$$$AUD/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$The US Dollar Index (DXY) is primarily run by EUR/USD as it makes up about 57% of the index. With that in mind, if the euro breaks the aforementioned support then the DXY should make good on its inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The March low could quickly come into play at 94.65. Should the DXY rise to that point we will want to pay close attention to momentum for cues as to whether the significant low from the spring will matter as resistance or not.$$$$U.S. Dollar Currency Index (DXY) Chart by TradingView.$$$$For all the charts we looked at, check out the video above…$$$$Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, DailyFX has several resources available to help you; indicator for tracking trader sentiment, quarterly trading forecasts, analytical and educational webinars held daily, and trading guides to help you improve trading performance. $$$$---Written by Paul Robinson, Market Analyst.$$$$You can follow Paul on Twitter at @PaulRobinsonFX.

Inflation in the Euro Area remains subdued and may prompt further action from the ECB in the coming months. Friday’s monthly and annual Euro Area inflation prints (September) are expected to miss both market expectations and last month’s negative out-turns adding extra pressure on the central bank to boost price pressures. Speaking at the latest ECB and its Watchers conference today, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that in the current low inflation environment, ‘the wider discussion today, however, is whether central banks should commit to explicitly making up for inflation misses when they have spent quite some time below their inflation goals….if credible, such a strategy can strengthen the capacity of monetary policy to stabilize the economy when faced with the lower bound’. In short, further monetary action to drive inflation higher.$$$$DailyFX Economic Data and Events Calendar.$$$$EUR/USD is currently just holding onto 1.1700 as US dollar strength and Euro weakness combine to keep downward pressure on the pair. This week’s short-term turnaround is being sold off and the 1.1600/1.1610 area may be tested again soon, especially if Friday’s inflation is poor. Last week’s 20- and 50-dma cross-over prompted further EUR/USD selling, causing the pair to become heavily oversold (CCI), and with precious few areas of decent support below 1.1600 on the chart, the ECB wishes for a lower EUR/USD rate may come to pass sooner rather than later. $$$$IG Retail trader data shows 37.45% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.67 to 1.

EUR/USD Analysis & News.$$$$Yesterday’s gains in the Euro had largely stemmed from month & quarter end rebalancing flows, which had been quite the contrary to various investment bank models touting USD buying. That said, EUR/USD has managed to hold onto gains with risk appetite better bid amid rising hopes of a potential stimulus package. However, as it stands, my view is that a stimulus package will not be agreed prior to the US election, thus headline risk over Mnuchin and Pelosi failing to reach an agreement remains.$$$$ECB officials continue to highlight that the appreciation in the Euro is a source of concern for the inflation outlook thus putting a lid on gains in the Euro in the short-term. Alongside this, with inflation expectations stalling since August, there is a growing sense that the ECB may have to look again at easing monetary policy further, particularly as Eurozone inflation risks remain tilted to the downside. $$$$Source: Refinitiv.$$$$Elsewhere, a narrative that may start to garner attention is the rift emerging over the EU recovery fund, in which the EU had released a report on the rule of law deficiencies, singling out Hungary and Poland. However, Germany’s compromise to resolve the issue has been criticised by the Netherlands, the Nordic countries and several MEPs, where an escalation in tensions could reduce the likelihood of a quick implementation of the recovery fund. As a reminder, the package needs to be voted unanimously to be rolled out.$$$$Vanilla Option Expiries (10am NY Cut Off) 1.1680-85 (2bln), 1.1700 (650m)        $$$$1.1750 (525m), 1.1775-80 (1bln), 1.1800 (1.5bln) $$$$Source: IG.$$$$10 Most Popular Candlestick Patterns.

The Euro is trading back at two-year highs against its US Dollar peer as EUR/USD price action spikes into the 1.19-handle. Euro strengthening against the US Dollar has prevailed as a key theme since EUR/USD started rocketing off the 1.08-price level this past May, but can the bullish trend push onward into the month ahead? $$$$August was turbulent for EUR/USD, which is the world’s most liquid and heavily traded major currency pair. In fact, EUR/USD rates fluctuated within a 270-pip trading range this past month. The Euro lost upward momentum as the US Dollar attempted to base, but in the wake of the Jackson Hole Symposium where the Fed announced average inflation targeting, spot EUR/USD seems to have resumed its ascent. Month-end rebalancing might be weighing positively on EUR/USD prices as well. $$$$EUR/USD bulls nevertheless face a key obstacle of technical resistance underpinned by the month-to-date swing high.

It looks like USD price action is strengthening broadly in response to preliminary PMI data for August 2020 just released by IHS Markit. US PMI data not only improved sequentially, but the leading economic indicators topped market estimates for both services and manufacturing components. Actual figures are detailed on the DailyFX Economic Calendar. $$$$Largely driven by evidence of diverging economic growth trajectories between the Eurozone and United States, spot EUR/USD has pushed considerably higher over recent weeks. This has helped steer the broader US Dollar to its weakest level in two years seeing that Euro performance makes up more than half of the DXY Index composition. $$$$That said, the bullish EUR/USD price trend has started to waver and is now showing signs of coming under pressure as the US Dollar attempts to base. US PMI data besting economic activity across the Eurozone could serve as one fundamental driver with enough credence to provide the DXY Index with a meaningful boost and help the US Dollar recoup recent downside. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$US Dollar rebound potential is also in consideration of a reversal from the July PMI narrative. FX traders may look to press key pivot points going forward with a focus on current month-to-date highs and month-to-date lows for the DXY Index as EUR/USD builds a range. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

US Dollar Index (DXY) is recovering off the jab to a level below the earlier-month low, that is resulting in catching fresh sellers off guard. At this time the move is considered corrective in nature, but nevertheless does appear to have some more upside before the rebound runs its course. Watch the May channel line, 2011 trend-line, and swing levels around 93.90 as a spot where the DXY could turn back lower from. This may make for an attractive risk/reward short for would-be shorts. A breakout above that point would indicate a larger reversal is underway. For now, waiting to see how resistance is handled, but a good chance we find that out in the days ahead.$$$$U.S. Dollar Currency Index (DXY) Chart by TradingView.$$$$If the DXY is in recovery mode, then EUR/USD is sinking. The fake-out breakout is at the least resulting in shaking out some weak hands before trading higher. A larger reversal may be underway, but first will look to support just a few pips under 11700, where we have the bottom of the recent range and the lower parallel of the May to current channel.

EUR/USD Price Waits for US NFPs, EUR/GBP Slides on Sterling Strength	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/08/06/EURUSD-Price-Waits-for-US-NFPs-EURGBP-Slides-on-Sterling-Strength.html	1596711600	EUR/USD consolidating near two-year highs. $$$$EUR/GBP struggling as Sterling pushes higher.	DailyFX Economic Data and Events Calendar.$$$$After hitting a new two-year high of 1.1916, EUR/USD is now trading in the middle of today’s range at 1.1865 and needs a new driver to make or break the recent rally. With the US dollar the main influence on the pair, Friday’s US Jobs Report is now key and will likely spark a fresh bout of volatility. Wednesday’s ADP report was a mixed bag with the July employment change disappointing – 167k vs expectations of 1500k – while the June number was revised sharply higher to 4314k from a prior 2369k. Last month’s nonfarm payrolls showed employment surging by 4.8 million in June, beating all analyst expectations by a wide margin. US President Donald Trump said yesterday that big jobs number was coming on Friday, so expect volatility in US dollar-related pairs. The data and events calendar and release times need to be closely watched for the rest of the week and fundamental analysis remains key.$$$$EUR/USD is likely to tread water ahead of tomorrow’s release and any downside is likely to be limited. The pair have made higher highs and higher lows all week, while the CCI indicator shows that the market is no longer overbought. All three moving averages remain supportive and it will take a decent rally by the US dollar to push the pair much below 1.1800 and the recent double-low area just below 1.1700.$$$$While EURUSD is being moved by the US dollar, EUR/GBP is being guided lower by a stronger British Pound. The UK currency is pushing aside concerns over the EU/UK trade talks and the recent uptick in new COVID-19 cases and is starting to pullback some of the recent losses seen in most GBP-pairs. GBP/NZD is up eight big figures from it’s late-July multi-month low, GBP/CAD is also up eight big figures from its mid-July low, while GBP/USD is up nearly 10 big figures from the end of June.$$$$EUR/GBP is now struggling to break back above its 20- and 50-day moving averages and is back below 0.9000 and moving lower. Two recent lows around 0.8975 are coming under threat which would leave the mid-July low at 0.8924 vulnerable. Volatility in the pair remains low and a slow grind lower may continue.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD and EUR/GBP – bullish or bearish??

As is usually the case on the first Friday of a new month, the major focus will be on the US Non-farm Payrolls report. However, while US President Trump stated that a “big” job number is coming on Friday, tightened restrictions through July showed a slight stalling in the Labour market. Alongside this, what had been evident in the ISM PMI’s earlier in the week had been the weaker than expected employment component as well as the ADP report and thus raising the risk of a weaker than expected headline print for today’s jobs report.$$$$NFP and Forex: What is NFP and How to Trade It?$$$$US & Canadian Jobs Data Due 13:30BST.$$$$Source: Refinitiv.$$$$Major USD Pairs Implied Range.$$$$Source: Refinitiv (These ranges are based on a 68.2% statistical probability that they will hold, spot price taken from 09:10BST).$$$$Little interest as of yet for 1.1900 to be taken out, having formed a double top. As such, with EUR/USD stalling at the 1.1900 handle, focus will be on pullbacks finding dip buyers before another retest topside resistance. On the downside, support is situated at 1.1800 and 1.1750.

The US dollar bounce off last Friday’s low has seemingly come to an end with the DXY back in negative territory for the session. While the recent series of lower highs and lower lows is broken, any move higher looks likely to be short-lived. On Friday, the latest US Jobs Report will be released and while another surprise cannot be ruled out, the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in the US will surely start to weigh again on employment prospects. Last month the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said that nonfarm payroll employment rose by 4.8 million in June, beating market expectations by a wide margin, while the unemployment rate fell to 11.1%. This Friday’s report (12:30 GMT) is expected to show another 1.6 million jobs added with the unemployment rate falling to 10.5%.$$$$Forex Fundamental Analysis – News that Matters.$$$$In the US, negotiations continue in Congress over the second COVID-19 stimulus package with the summer recess set to start on August 7. While it is likely a compromise will be found and the package passed this week, if Congress doesn’t pass the stimulus package, members will be likely called back during the one-month recess to continue negotiations. $$$$DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$US Treasury yields continue to hoover around multi-year and record all-time lows as the dollar printing press shows no sign of slowing down. These ultra-low yields are now attracting borrowers with Alphabet (Google) selling a multi-tranche USD10 billion package of debt yesterday. The sale was said to be three times oversubscribed with Alphabet borrowing money at record low yields. $$$$The latest CoT report – week ending Wednesday July 29 - showed speculators continuing to short the US dollar with their bearish exposure now close to extreme levels last seen in 2011. Friday’s dead cat bounce may have been caused by traders trimming some of this exposure ahead of the weekend.$$$$US Dollar Shorts Becoming Extreme, EUR/USD at Risk of Reversal.$$$$The daily US dollar chart suggests that any uptick will run into short-term resistance from 94.00 to the 20-dma around 94.66, while last Friday’s low at 92.51 remains initial support. The DXY has moved out of oversold territory for the first time in a month, while volatility (CCI) remains fairly consistent.$$$$What is your view on the US Dollar – bullish or bearish??

US Dollar Slides Lower - GBPUSD and EURUSD Outlooks	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/08/13/US-Dollar-Slides-Lower-GBPUSD-and-EURUSD-Outlooks.html	1597316400	US Treasury yields nudging lower after successful 3- and 10-year auctions.  $$$$GBP/USD and EUR/USD grind higher in lackluster trade.	The US Treasury successfully sold a record $38 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday, following a well-received sale of $48 billion of 3-year notes on Tuesday. The US Treasury will sell $26 billion of 30-year bonds later today. This record sale of notes and bonds put pressure on outstanding USTs this week, driving yields higher as investors and traders sought to buy bonds at cheaper prices. With this selling pressure now eased, UST yields look set to resume their path lower. $$$$Via Investing.Com.$$$$DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$US dollar weakness has helped GBP/USD steady above 1.2950 in the past couple of weeks, despite recent data releases showing the underlying weakness of the UK economy. Wednesday’s Q2 GDP release showed the UK economy contracting at the fastest quarterly rate on record, although the June monthly GDP figure of +8.7% gave markets some hope for the future. Unemployment is still expected to ratchet higher over the rest of the year, especially after the furlough scheme ends, with the Bank of England expecting the unemployment rate to hit 7.5% by the end of the year. Looking forward, the outlook for Sterling may be biased towards the downside, but ongoing USD weakness may allow the pair to move higher, with the March 9 high at 1.3202 the next target. There seems to be reasonable short-term support back down to 1.2950.$$$$A solid performance for EUR/USD this week with the pair now eyeing the recent 27-month high at 1.1916. The pair tested and then rebounded off the supportive 20-dma on Tuesday and a break and close above 1.1881 should add extra support for a renewed push higher. A cluster of old lows and the 20-dma should prove supportive down to just under 1.1700. The CCI indicator is moving towards overbought territory and should be followed closely, suggesting that a move higher may be more of a grind than a breakout.$$$$What is your view on the GBPUSD and EURUSD– bullish or bearish??

Markets in Limbo as Volatility Gyrates: VIX, EVZ, VXEEM, OVX	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/08/10/markets-in-limbo-as-volatility-gyrates-vix-evz-vxeem-ovx.html	1597081560	Market sentiment hesitates as traders grow weary about fiscal stimulus and trade tensions.$$$$Popular cross-asset volatility benchmarks like the VIX Index remain broadly suppressed.$$$$EM equities and VXEEM could highlight potential changes in appetite for risk.	Investor risk appetite appears to be wavering as global markets trade broadly mixed. This largely comes on the back of a fiscal stimulus stalemate enduring in US congress and a notable escalation in Sino-American trade war tension. Not to mention, coronavirus concerns still linger due to building evidence of a worldwide second wave. $$$$That said, most benchmarks of cross-asset volatility have drifted lower over recent months and weeks. Perhaps an ongoing volatility cycle normalization after the blow-up this past spring largely explains this, which a seasonal summer lull in market activity could be exacerbating. Thus it seems that complacency is likely on the rise as investors continue looking past several notable fundamental headwinds. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$President Trump signed executive orders over the weekend aimed at extending unemployment benefits and foreclosure protections while also moving to temporarily waive student loan interest payments and defer payroll taxes. Yet, the unilateral action by Trump may face several legal hurdles, and further fuels uncertainty surrounding congressional gridlock over fiscal stimulus talks, which could weigh notably on the S&P 500 VIX Index. A sharp rise in the VIX ‘fear-gauge’ could signal that investor uncertainty is climbing with demand for S&P 500 downside protection. $$$$Also, US-China tensions ramped notably late last week. This follows the Trump administration seeking to ban Chinese tech companies like TikTok and WeChat from operating in the United States due to national security concerns. Further, sanctions were placed on Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam after the country’s democratic election was delayed. It appears that this is putting pressure on emerging market equities as indicated by a spike in the VXEEM Index and modest uptick in expected crude oil volatility. $$$$Implied volatility for the Euro has started to edge back lower after an advance late last month that corresponded with a US Dollar relief bounce. This suggests potential for EUR/USD price action to remain relatively supported as demand for safe-haven currencies, like the US Dollar, keeps fading. US Dollar weakness may linger in turn, which may provide a positive tailwind to risk assets such as the S&P 500 Index, emerging market stocks, and crude oil. Consequently, in light of these conflicting fundamental drivers that loom over markets, it could be prudent to consider range trading strategies given the macroeconomic backdrop. $$$$Read More: Gold Price Forecast Bright & Volatile as USD, Real Yields Swing.$$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

Prior to the opening bell on Wall Street, the broad-based US Dollar Index was deep in the red, down nearly 0.4% intraday.

EUR/GBP Price Outlook: Support Broken as Euro Weakness Weighs Further	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/09/02/EURGBP-Price-Outlook-Support-Broken-as-Euro-Weakness-Weighs-Further.html	1599043680	ECB chief economist unnerved as Euro Zone turns negative.  $$$$EUR/GBP breaks multi-month support.	The European Central Bank may need to act soon if inflation in the Euro Zone fails to turn higher over the next few months. Tuesday’s first look at price pressure missed already lowly expectations with both the m/m and y/y rate both in negative territory as the economy continues to be buffeted by the effects of the COVID-19 virus.$$$$While the ECB says that they don’t target a specific exchange rate, comments by the ECB chief economist suggest that they are keeping a very close watch on the single currency. When EUR/USD briefly hit a 28-month high of 1.2010 yesterday, ECB’ Philip Lane said that the 1.200 EUR/USD level ‘matters’, leaving the market speculating that further stimulus measures may be needed to boost the growth and price pressures in the Euro Zone.

The United States has ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, in a move that will escalate tensions between the two superpowers further. The demand to close the consulate was a ‘political provocation unilaterally launched by the US’ and would ‘sabotage China-US relations’ according to Chinese foreign minister Wang Wenbin. China and the US remain at loggerheads over a range of issues and this latest move will likely draw a quick response from China, ratcheting up the friction between the two countries. The US dollar caught a small bid after the announcement hit the market, but the pull-back was muted and less than half of Tuesday’s sell-off.$$$$EUR/USD has been moving higher in recent sessions on a combination of ongoing US dollar weakness and relief that the EU COVID-19 recovery plan was finally agreed early Tuesday. The deal will now consist of EUR390bn in grants, down from the originally mooted EUR500bn, and EUR360bn of loans, up from EUR250bn. The plan will be funded by debt issuance in international markets.$$$$The pair touched a fresh 18-month high of 1.1547 earlier in today’s session before paring gains after the US-China news hit the screens.The daily chart remains positive with a series of higher lows in place after the 50-dma/200-dma golden crossover made on June 22. The next likely levels of resistance are from two swing highs on the weekly chart at 1.1570 (January 2019) and 1.1815 (September 2018). A break below 1.1500 may see 1.1422 tested in the short-term.

Euro Price Analysis: EUR/USD Breaks Above Key Level of Prior Resistance	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/07/22/Euro-Price-Analysis-TDC-EURUSD-Breaks-Above-Key-Level-of-Prior-Resistance.html	1595431800	USD remains under pressure as US-China tensions rise.$$$$EUR/USD trading at key Fibonacci levels.$$$$Will bulls be able to break through key area of resistance or is the pair overbought, as indicated by the RSI?	EUR/USD Forecast:$$$$The EU summit ended yesterday with EU leaders securing a €750 billion recovery fund, aimed at supporting European economies to recover from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, inflows into the euro have accelerated, while growing US-China tensions, combined with an increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the US, continues to add pressure to the Dollar. $$$$The weekly chart below highlights Fibonacci levels from two major moves. The first Fibonacci retracement (pink) is taken from the January 2017 low to the February 2018 high (the medium-term move), while the second Fibonacci retracement (purple), represents the shorter-term move between the February 2018 high and the March 2020 low.$$$$Since August 2019, the EUR/USD has been trading in a key area of confluence between the 76.4% and 61.8% retracement of the medium-term Fibonacci. This relatively tight span containing the two above-mentioned Fibonacci levels has formed clear areas of support and resistance. However, after breaking through the 61.8% level (1.11846), price action has favored the bulls, with the 50% retracement of the medium-term move now forming a level of support at 1.14407.$$$$EUR/USD Weekly Chart.$$$$Chart created by Tammy Da Costa, IG.$$$$With Fibonacci levels holding strong, the RSI indicates that the EUR/USD may be entering into overbought territory. While the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical indicator which is commonly used to measure the momentum of the trend, it is often used to determine when a financial instrument enters into periods of overbought or oversold territory.  $$$$As highlighted on the 4 hour chart below, the RSI is trading above 70, signaling that although a strong upward trend is present, the pair may be entering into overbought territory. Should the RSI cross from above the 70 line towards the downside, bears may see it as a sign that a reversal may be on the cards.$$$$EUR/USD 4-Hour Chart.$$$$Chart prepared by Tammy Da Costa, IG.$$$$As price action continues to fluctuate between the short-term and medium-term Fibonacci levels, bulls continue to fight for a breakout above the 50% retracement of the shorter-term Fibonacci at 1.15990, towards the psychological level of 1.16. Should this level be broken, the upside may prevail with the 38.2% retracement of the medium-term Fibonacci providing resistance at 1.17095.$$$$Meanwhile, bears may be looking for an opportunity of a reversal should prices fall below 1.14471, which is the 50% retracement of the medium-term move. If this level is broken, the 38.2% retracement of the shorter-term move, may be the next level of support at 1.13724.$$$$According to client sentiment, at the time of writing, majority of retail traders are showing a bearing bias towards EUR/USD, with 71% of traders holding short positions. We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests that the EUR/USD may rise.$$$$--- Written by Tammy DaCosta, Market Writer for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow Tammy on Twitter: @Tams707.

GBP/USD has been given a mild boost, and EUR/GBP is sliding modestly, after news of an unexpected increase in UK inflation in June to 0.6% year/year from 0.5% in May. Analysts polled by the news agencies had predicted a dip to 0.4% but the figure came in higher because of an increase in the price of gaming consoles during lockdown.$$$$Meanwhile, UK consumer spending fell at a much slower rate last month as Covid-19 restrictions were eased, according to Visa’s UK consumer spending index. This report is not watched closely in the markets but GBP bulls may take heart from its finding that, on a monthly basis, spending rose a record 16.6% following an 11.2% increase in May.$$$$Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)$$$$Looking ahead, the next moves in EUR/GBP will likely be determined by the outcomes of Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank’s rate-setting Governing Council and the European Council summit on Friday/Saturday to discuss the proposed EU recovery fund.$$$$You can find a guide here to how the ECB’s monetary policy decisions can affect the value of the Euro.$$$$The ECB will likely leave Eurozone monetary policy unchanged but its president, Christine Lagarde, could potentially move the Euro at her press conference following the decision. Rather more important will be the attempts to reach agreement on the proposed €750 billion fund despite opposition from the “frugal four”: Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden. A failure to agree is seen as probable but could still weaken EUR/USD and EUR/GBP.$$$$Ahead of that, UK employment data due Thursday are not expected to move GBP, with analysts predicting a rise of 250,000 in claimants in June, down from a 528,900 increase in May.$$$$We look at currencies regularly in the DailyFX Trading Global Markets Decoded podcasts that you can find here on Apple or wherever you go for your podcasts.$$$$--- Written by Martin Essex, Analyst and Editor.$$$$Feel free to contact me on Twitter @MartinSEssex.

The European Central Bank has left all its monetary policy settings unchanged, as was widely expected after its decision last month to respond to the economic downturn caused by the spread of coronavirus infections by increasing its pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP) by €600 billion to €1.35 trillion, extending the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of June next year and reinvesting the maturing principal payments from securities bought under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022.$$$$The ECB’s Governing Council had already made clear that it would need more time to assess the impact of the June measures so, while further ECB action is possible later this year, the Euro barely moved after its latest statement.$$$$Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)$$$$That leaves Euro traders free to concentrate on the ebb and flow of market sentiment, determined currently by the state of US-China relations, the possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 infections around the world and the latest corporate earnings reports. However, trading in EUR/USD early next week will likely be dominated by the outcome of an EU Summit this coming Friday and Saturday, when EU leaders will attempt to reach a consensus on a recovery fund for the EU economy.$$$$The special meeting of the European Council could be fractious as the current plan is for an EU recovery fund consisting of €500 billion of grants and €250 billion of loans to help the weakest members of the bloc recover from the coronavirus pandemic. This faces opposition from the so-called “frugal four”: Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, and failure to agree would almost certainly send the Euro lower.$$$$However, the ECB is keen for the EU leaders to complement its actions with fiscal policy measures and these summits tend to end with a compromise; a potential positive for EUR/USD and the Euro crosses. That seems likely this time too, although it is also possible that further talks will be needed before a final agreement is reached.$$$$We look at currencies and central banks regularly in the DailyFX Trading Global Markets Decoded podcasts that you can find here on Apple or wherever you go for your podcasts.$$$$You can find out how the ECB’s monetary policy can affect the value of the Euro by clicking here.$$$$--- Written by Martin Essex, Analyst and Editor.$$$$Feel free to contact me on Twitter @MartinSEssex.

EUR/USD has been a bit choppy, but nevertheless it keeps on heading higher towards its best levels since the March spike. The change in character the past month suggests the rally could even grow legs at some point. The change in character in reference, is the fact that after the June rally the Euro didn’t fall apart as it has done after every rally since early 2018. But before EUR/USD can string together a sizable rally the March high at 11495 will need to be exceeded, then the trend-line from 2008 up near 11700. For now the bias is bullish until we see pervasive price action or a strong rejection at one of the thresholds mentioned above.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$Gold price is treading water around the 1800-mark where three peaks were created in 2011/12 following the bull market high of 2011. But despite this major threshold, gold is holding up well in the absence of any major selling pressure. In the near-term, there is a nice upward trajectory that keeps the metal moving higher. As long as the July 14 low at 1790 holds, then so should the upward bias. A strong push into the 1800s could see gold start to rise towards the 2011 high at 1920. A break of 1790 (& trend-line support) would be reason for turning cautious, if not outright bearish.$$$$Gold Price Chart by TradingView.$$$$Gold Price Chart by TradingView.$$$$For all the charts we looked at, check out the video above…$$$$Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, DailyFX has several resources available to help you; indicator for tracking trader sentiment, quarterly trading forecasts, analytical and educational webinars held daily, and trading guides to help you improve trading performance. $$$$---Written by Paul Robinson, Market Analyst.$$$$You can follow Paul on Twitter at @PaulRobinsonFX.

The EUR/USD isn’t blowing the doors off on the top-side, but is still working its way higher in bullish fashion. If it is to keep on rallying at some point it seems likely we will see momentum begin picking up. Currently the March spike-high is being tested and upon a break of the 11495 level the next targeted resistance line is the 2008 trend-line that is running down over peaks in 2011, 2014, and 2018. To negate a bullish outlook we would need to see a hard break lower towards 11300. Otherwise, short-term dip-buying opportunities could be the way to go for capitalizing on further gains in the Euro. $$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$USD/CAD is currently working on a breakdown out of a range and below support created via several lows that have formed around the 200-day MA over the past month. A close below 13485 should set up for more selling in the days ahead, with the June low next up in focus around 13315. Beneath that point lies a trend-line rising up from 2017 that could also come into play near the 13200 mark.

The US Dollar is disintegrating broadly and sinking the DXY Index – a basket of major currency pairs heavily weighted toward EUR/USD price action – back into negative territory on the year. Ongoing US Dollar devaluation has helped gold performance shine exceptionally bright over the last few months as the precious metal notches another fresh multi-year high. $$$$Meanwhile, as the tsunami of stimulus from governments and central banks drowns the market in liquidity, investor risk appetite has grown abundant. This has largely facilitated a swift v-shape recovery by stocks and major equity indices, like the S&P 500, which now trades in the green year-to-date. Similarly, crude oil price action has staged an impressive rebound as business activity and global GDP growth outlook bounce back subsequent to the coronavirus lockdown.  $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$Aggressive shifts across the market sentiment spectrum throughout the year – from complacency early February, to extreme fear during March, and to the current state of euphoria – can be illustrated by tracking cross-asset volatility benchmarks. For example, the popular S&P 500 VIX Index, which is often referred to as the ‘fear-gauge’ on Wall Street, surged earlier this year to levels last seen amid the global financial crisis. $$$$The VIX Index has since deflated, however, and reversed nearly all of its meteoric rise as investor confidence improves while the economy recovers from its sharpest downturn in modern history. Less-known yet equally insightful measures of market volatility, like the EVZ Index or VXHYG Index, mirror the VIX Index and depict the same narrative. EVZ and VXHYG indicate expected volatility, or perceived uncertainty, surrounding the Euro and high-yield corporate debt over the next 30-days, respectively. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$Seeing that cross-asset volatility benchmarks generally maintain a strong inverse relationship with risk assets, like stocks, it is unsurprising that the S&P 500 keeps marching higher with the VIX Index bleeding lower. Congruently, it is worth mentioning that stocks bottomed shortly after the VIX topped out earlier this year. $$$$Despite the S&P 500 officially reclaiming its January opening level, however, the VIX ‘fear-gauge’ still seems elevated on a relative basis. Perhaps this highlights lingering investor uncertainty and skepticism toward the stock market rally driven predominantly by expanding price-to-earnings multiples in the midst of more than 30-million Americans filing for unemployment insurance last week.$$$$That said, if the VIX Index stays fairly buoyant, it might suggest the S&P 500 faces an uphill battle as equity investors continue seeking downside protection. Alternatively, if stock market euphoria prevails, copious amounts liquidity on the sidelines, in addition to hopes for another round of fiscal stimulus from the US government, could keep steering stocks higher and exerting downward pressure on the VIX in turn. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

The latest Eurozone Markit PMI readings show business activity picking-up and growing at the sharpest rate in just over two years. The French services and composite indices both hit 30-month highs, while in Germany, the composite index hit a 23-month high and the services index also hit a 30-month high. Overall the Eurozone PMI data beat market expectations with ease with all three indicators back in expansion territory.$$$$DailyFX Economic Data and Events Calendar.$$$$According to Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, ‘the data add to signs that the economy should see a strong rebound after the unprecedented collapse in the second quarter’. He added that while the survey hints at an initial V-shaped recovery, other indicators such as backlogs of work and employment ‘warn of downside risks to the outlook’. $$$$The latest readings will please the ECB who kept all policy measures unchanged at last week’s policy meeting. The central bank continues to provide abundant liquidity and support to the economy via targeted policy tools after COVID-19 delivered the ‘largest shock to the European economy since the Second World War’, according to ECB President Lagarde in a recent blog post. $$$$How Central Banks Impact the Forex Market.$$$$EUR/USD made a fresh 21-month high earlier in the session, aided in part by a weak US dollar. The pair have trimmed earlier gains after this week’s 225 pip rally but the overall technical set-up remains positive. After making a double low in late-March of 1.0635, the pair have turned higher with any setbacks seen as an opportunity to get back onto the trend. The daily chart shows a near-unbroken set of higher lows and higher highs in July, while the pair trade above all three moving averages by a distance. The CCI indicator warns that the pair are overbought, which may temper any move higher in the short-term. The September 2018 high at 1.1815 may still come pressure, especially if the US dollar sells-off again in the run-up to next Wednesday’s FOMC meeting.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

DAX 30 & CAC 40 Forecasts for the Week Ahead	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/07/28/DAX-30-CAC-40-Forecasts-for-the-Week-Ahead.html	1595955600	DAX 30 traders struggle to breach resistance marked by prior highs around 12,930.$$$$The CAC 40 has fallen behind the DAX as it languishes beneath recent peaks and nearby resistance.$$$$How to Trade Dax 30: Trading Strategies and Tips.	Price action has been aggressive to start the week in a variety of markets, ranging from gold and silver to EUR/USD. While volatility and break outs have been plentiful, price action across the European indices, particularly the DAX 30 and CAC 40, has been wholly unimpressive. That said, the disappointing performance from the markets in question has helped delineate clear technical boundaries that may impact price once volatility picks up.  $$$$In the case of the DAX 30, price has shown a reluctance to break above the June high near 12,930. As a result, we can wager this level is an area of possible resistance and the closest to the current trading price. Subsequent resistance may be found along the ascending trendline from March, which currently resides slightly above the projected barrier at 12,930. That said, both levels will have to be surpassed before the DAX 30 can take aim at the July peak at 13,310. A successful move above this level would be an encouraging development for a continuation higher.  $$$$Conversely, nearby support is rather sparse. Apart from the various July swing highs that may provide influence on an intraday basis, the index seems to lack notable support until the Fibonacci level at 12,448.Therefore, the topside appears the more perilous of the two paths but remains a possibility against the broader backdrop that has seen price climb from the March lows.$$$$Either way, a break above outlined resistance will be required before a larger bullish break can be established. Thankfully for the in pursuit of volatility, the week ahead possesses major event risk in the form of a FOMC meeting and corporate earnings from the Nasdaq’s most influential members. Together, the announcements could seriously shake up the Nasdaq – the current pacesetter across equity markets – and therefore the DAX. In the meantime, follow @PeterHanksFX on Twitter for updates and analysis.$$$$The CAC 40 will also await information from the upcoming events as it trades sideways within a clearly defined range. Given the distance from the current price to the outlined technical barriers, persistent volatility may be required for a serious break out in either direction. With that in mind, the possible resistance from 5,130 to 5,240 and potential support around 4,823 and 4,670, has made the French equity index ripe for range trading opportunities. $$$$The 3 Step Range Trading Strategy.$$$$--Written by Peter Hanks, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow Peter on Twitter @PeterHanksFX.
USD Price Outlook: US Dollar Reversal Attempt Eyed vs EUR & AUD	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/08/03/usd-price-outlook-us-dollar-reversal-attempt-eyed-vs-eur-aud.html	1596471000	US Dollar notched a sharp 4% decline last month measured by the DXY Index.$$$$USD aims to claw back recent downside as the Euro and Australian Dollar waver.$$$$EUR/USD and AUD/USD rates may revert lower amid coronavirus second wave risk.	The US Dollar is coming off its worst month of performance since April 2011 after a steep 4% slide lower in the DXY Index. USD price action stumbled across several major and emerging market currency pairs throughout July, but US Dollar weakness was noteworthy against its Euro and Australian Dollar peers in particular. $$$$This has threatened the Greenback’s King Dollar title as a bearish trend begins to emerge with the broader DXY Index perched about 10% below March’s swing high. That said, with EUR/USD and AUD/USD edging lower over the last two trading sessions, the US Dollar is starting to show signs of life and brings potential for a larger reversal into focus. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$Looking at a monthly US Dollar Index chart reveals a long-standing bullish channel of support extended through a series of higher lows since 2011. Along with the chance for a possible mean-reversion higher, this zone of technical support may provide some buoyancy to the broader US Dollar and alleviate recent selling pressure despite extended USD swap lines. $$$$Not to mention, a primary driver facilitating recent US Dollar weakness has likely included the prospect of diverging economic growth trajectories between the United States and other developed economies, such as the Eurozone or Australia. Shifting winds could cause this fundamental narrative to change in consideration of rising coronavirus second wave risk outside of the US, which may offer a catalyst sparking a bullish US Dollar reversal if this theme can garner more credence.  $$$$EUR/USD price action has already started to show signs that Euro bulls have grown exhausted. This is suggested by the noteworthy 200-pip tumble recorded by EUR/USD since Friday’s swing high and follows a possible double-top pattern at the 1.1900-handle. $$$$Further, spot EUR/USD now trades below its 8-day moving average as the relative strength index drifts lower out of ‘overbought’ territory. Maintaining the short-term moving average could indicate that EUR/USD bulls remain in the driver seat, but sliding below this technical barrier might signal a larger pullback could be in play.$$$$AUD/USD price action similarly shows recent US Dollar weakness abating. The pro-risk Aussie has slid over 100-pips against its US Dollar peer after breaching the 0.7200-price level late last week. $$$$This reiterates a possible bearish rising wedge pattern seemingly formed by AUD/USD throughout the year. Likewise, negative divergence shown on the MACD hints at waning upward momentum and potential for a reversal. A break beneath the lower support line could indicate the US Dollar may continue clawing back recent downside. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.
FOMC Meeting in Focus: Risks of EUR/USD Breakout With King Dollar Dethroned	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/06/10/FOMC-Meeting-in-Focus-Risks-of-EURUSD-Breakout-With-King-Dollar-Dethroned-.html	1591786800	Fed SEPs Return, No Major Policy Changes for Now.$$$$Fed Looking to Maintain Positive Mood Music.$$$$Option Market Signals: Topside Risk for EUR/USD.	The main event of the session will be the Federal Reserve monetary policy decision due at 1900BST. In light of the recent rhetoric from Fed officials, the central bank is not expected to announce any major policy changes. However, this meeting will see the returns of the SEPs (Staff Economic Projections) with particular focus likely on the rate outlook to guide future monetary policy.$$$$Since the prior Fed monetary policy meeting, the US has embarked on the journey of slowly reopening the economy, which has seemingly run rather smoothly. Alongside this, data has also picked up from the very weak levels, most notably the US jobs report, which showed a 2.5mln gain in May following a 20.5mln loss in the prior month. However, the Fed is likely to highlight that now is not the time to take the foot off the gas and thus maintain an easing bias on the basis that the outlook remains uncertain and that economic growth is still very weak.$$$$Ahead of the FOMC meeting, option-implied vols have picked up capturing the risk event. EUR/USD ATM overnight vols have gained 5.33 to 14.35, which in turn signals a 68pip break-even (meaning that ATM option straddles will profit on a move over 68pips). Alongside this, option traders have also demanded greater protection for Euro calls, suggesting potential topside risk for the EUR/USD. Before the meeting, Euro spot price may be somewhat contained between 1.13 and 1.14, given sizeable option expiries rolling off at the 10 AM NY cut. That said, with a Fed who is looking to keep volatility at bay, the US Dollar may continue to downtrend, helping lift EUR/USD back to 1.14.$$$$Source: Refinitiv, DailyFX.$$$$Option Implied Move.$$$$Source: Refinitiv, DailyFX.$$$$Source: IG Charts.$$$$--- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst.$$$$Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX.
Euro Could Trim Gains on Political Friction Over EU Aid Package	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/06/11/Euro-Could-Trim-Gains-on-Political-Friction-Over-EU-Aid-Package.html	1591837200	Politically-sensitive Euro may face heightened liquidation pressure amid intra-regional tension.$$$$Deliberations over EUR750 billion EU aid package could rattle fragile sovereign debt markets.$$$$EUR/USD price action could turn more bearish as pair stalls just below multi-month resistance 	Since late-May, the Euro has risen a little over 4.50 percent against the US Dollar counterpart, in large part due to two factors. The first has been the market-wide selloff in the Greenback, and the other has been cautiously hopeful signs of political unity in Europe. Euro strength was also buttressed by the ECB’s unexpected addition of EUR600b to its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP). $$$$Recently, the European Commission proposed a 750 billion Euro stimulus plan, 500b of which would be given in the forms of grants to economies and sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic. The remaining 250b Euros would be distributed in the forms of loans. The news helped to bring sovereign bond yields on structurally-distressed states – like Italy and many in the Mediterranean – down and pushed the Euro higher. $$$$Italian 10-Year Bond Yields, EUR/CHF, EUR/USD – 4-Hour Chart.$$$$EUR/USD chart created using TradingVuew.$$$$While the prospect of unity and quelled fears of a sovereign debt crisis helped restore risk appetite in Europe, prolonged deliberations and delayed implementation could reverse these positive developments. Later today, Eurozone finance ministers will be meeting to discuss the recovery package and to debate key questions about distribution and oversight. $$$$Fiscally-conservative European lawmakers in Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden expressed a preference in changing the constitution of the aid from grants to loans. Southern member states have been leaning more towards grants and debt-mutualizing measures like the so-called coronabonds. The latter caused the political rift between North and South to widen amid the pandemic. $$$$The other issue is oversight. Member states bordering the Mediterranean have a strong reluctance to accept loans that are monitored by institutions outside their borders. The Greek debt crisis eight years put a sour taste in many Southern lawmakers’ mouths, and has been part of the reason why that area in Europe has been known to foster more Euroscepticism than its Northern counterparts. $$$$The issue about oversight may therefore become a sticking point and possibly lead to delayed implementation. The Commission has suggested that member states create a recovery plan that requires each recipient to outline their intended reforms and investment priories until 2024. The upcoming meeting may provide insight as to how next week’s conference among EU leaders will go, which could either pressure or push the Euro higher. $$$$EUR/USD has had a remarkable ascent ever since it broke out of the 1.0783-0.1981 congestive range, though its rise may be showing signs of exhaustion. The pair’s ascent in large part owes its thanks to an aggressive selloff in the US Dollar. A short-term pullback could see the pair retreat to a familiar stalling point at 1.1287, and if that fails to keep EUR/USD afloat it could open the door to retesting the floor at 1.1147. $$$$EUR/USD – Daily Chart.$$$$EUR/USD chart created using TradingView.$$$$--- Written by Dimitri Zabelin, Currency Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$To contact Dimitri, use the comments section below or @ZabelinDimitriTwitter.

The final Euro-Zone composite PMI (May) picked-up sharply from April’s multi-decade low, suggesting that economic slump in the region is starting to turn round. While encouraging, and with future PMIs likely to show business activity picking up as lockdown measures are unwound, Euro-Zone GDP is ‘set to fall at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter, accompanied by the largest rise in unemployment seen in the history of the euro area’ according to Chris Williamson, chief business economist at data provider IHS market.$$$$The final Euro-Zone composite index rose to 31.9 compared to a flash reading of 30.5 and April’s multi-decade low of 13.6. The services index rose to 30.5 compared to a flash reading of 28.7 and a prior month’s 12.0.$$$$The report noted that while optimism has returned, and pessimism moderated, ‘Our forecasters expect GDP to slump by almost 9% in 2020 and for a recovery to pre-pandemic levels of output to take several years’. $$$$IHS Markit PMI Release  $$$$The global risk-on rally remains in full-flow with riskier assets in demand as central bank benevolence eclipses political and economic uncertainty. The safe-haven US dollar remains out of favor and has dropped below the important 200-day moving average and continues to print lower highs and lower lows, suggesting further losses ahead. The outlook for EUR/USD remains positive unless this risk tone reverses.$$$$US Dollar Out of Favor, Global Risk Rally in Full Swing – Cross Asset Correlation.$$$$The ECB meeting on Thursday will likely see the central bank increase its recently announced Pandemic Emergency Response Program (PEPP) further to boost market liquidity further. The original EUR 750 billion program launched in March is expected to be completed by October and as such a further increase of EUR 500-750 billion is likely to be announced Thursday. $$$$The EUR/USD short-term rally off the May 25 low at 1.0870 continues with the pair breaking through the 200-dma on May 28 and not looking back. The 50% Fibonacci retracement of the March 9-22 sell-off was also broken on the same day, with the 61.8% Fib at 1.1107 also taken out this week. Higher lows and higher highs dominate recent price action and there is now little in the way of a complete re-trace of the March sell-off. The CCI indicator shows that the market is currently overbought, adding a note of caution to further upside, but overall unless the global risk sentiment changes or the US dollar gets a strong, lasting bid, EUR/USD looks set to probe fresh multi-week highs.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

EUR/USD Price Analysis & News.$$$$Bottom Line: Larger Than Expected ECB Package.$$$$The ECB announced that it would add EUR 600bln to its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP), exceeding expectations of EUR 500bln, while also extending the program till June 2021. Alongside this, the ECB noted that it would reinvest maturing PEPP bonds until the end of 2022 at least, which is of note, given that it would allow the ECB to be able to deviate more from its capital key and for longer (beneficial for peripheral debt).$$$$In reaction to the larger than expected stimulus package, the Euro jumped to fresh highs of 1.1270 from 1.1200. However, the largest move had been observed in Italian bonds as BTP futures soared on the announcement (BTP yields dropping to fresh lows). Keep in mind, that BTPs has been the largest beneficiary of the ECB’s stimulus program with the central bank noting this week that in the first two months of PEPP, Italian bonds had taken up the largest share of the purchases.$$$$In the press conference, ECB’s Lagarde noted that the central bank had not discussed including junk bonds into the program. However, one aspect to focus on for the minutes, which will be released later this month is that there had been a “broad” consensus over the size of PEPP, suggesting that not all members had agreed to the size of EUR 600bln.$$$$Economic Forecasts.$$$$Source: ECB.$$$$Source: DailyFX.$$$$--- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst.$$$$Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX.
Post-Brexit Trade Talks Latest - EU and UK Upping the Ante on Trade Negotiations	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/06/12/Post-Brexit-Trade-Talks-Latest-EU-and-UK-Upping-the-Ante-on-Trade-Negotiations.html	1591966800	High levels trade talks on Monday.$$$$No extension to the transition period.$$$$A new series of EU/UK future relation negotiations.	UK PM Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak via video link on Monday afternoon, June 15, in the latest attempt to get EU/UK trade talks back on track. The talks have made no real progress so far and with the UK refusing to extend talks further, this high level meeting, along with a new set of discussions just announced, may well break the current deadlock. And a breakthrough is needed as the EU Commission has just formally accepted that the UK’s refusal to extend the trade talks is final. After speaking with UK cabinet member Michael Gove, who reiterated that there will be no extension of the transition period, EU Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said that while the EU remains open to an extension, they accept that the UK’s position is definitive.$$$$The EU and UK negotiating teams have also just announced further negotiating rounds will take place in July, August and September, ‘in order to intensify the talks and to create the most conducive conditions for concluding and ratifying a deal before the end of 2020’. In addition, the Chief Negotiators from both sides with their teams. ‘will meet as necessary in a more restricted format to ensure progress in the negotiations’.$$$$While these additional talks may add some impetus to the negotiations, the two sides remain far apart and entrenched over the role of the European Court of Justice, a level playing field for UK and European businesses and EU access to UK fishing waters. Both sides continue to blame each other over a lack of movement and it will take a major backdown by one or both sides to get the talks moving forward. Any sign of progress in these talks will boost sentiment in both the Euro and Sterling and help steer the conversation away from the economic destruction caused to both sides from the COVID-19 virus.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

EUR/USD Weakness Continues as The US Dollar Catches a Pre-FOMC Bid	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/06/09/EURUSD-Weakness-Continues-as-The-US-Dollar-Catches-a-Pre-FOMC-Bid.html	1591700400	Euro-Zone Q1 GDP contracts by 3.6%.$$$$EUR/USD starting a series of lower highs. 	Euro-Zone Q1 GDP came in slightly better-than-expected earlier today at -3.6% q/q compared to earlier forecasts of -3.8%. According to Eurostat,among Member States for which data are available for the first quarter of 2020, Ireland (+1.2%), Bulgaria and Romania (both +0.3%) as well as Sweden (+0.1%) still recorded postitive growth compared with the previous quarter, while GDP fell in all other EU Member states, with the highest declines in France and Italy (both -5.3%) as well as Spain and Slovakia (both -5.2%).$$$$Earlier in the session, data from the Federal Statistics Office, Destatis, showed German exports and imports slumping in April, missing already pessimistic expectations. Exports were down 24% on the previous month and 31.1% lower on the same month a year earlier, while imports fell 16.5% and 21.6% respectively. The export decline compared to April 2019 was the largest fall since the introduction of foreign trade statistics in 1950. $$$$The single currency remains weak against the US dollar and slipped below 1.1250 in early trade. The greenback is starting to pick up a bid after its recent heavy falls as traders wait for the main event of the week, the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. Expectations are starting to build that Fed chair Jerome Powell may signal that the US economy is starting to turn around, especially after last Friday’s US jobs report, and if this is the case, the greenback will likely pick up a further bid. The recent EURUSD slide has seen the pair print three successive lower highs and lower lows – disregarding the Sunday candle – leaving 1.1200 vulnerable ahead of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at 1.1107. The 14-day ATR remains steady around 73 pips while the CCI indicator has moved out of overbought territory.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

Upcoming US retail sales data (13:30 UK) and the Fed chair Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress (15:00 UK) will drive the next short-term move in EUR/USD and will likely guide the pair for the weeks ahead. The US dollar is currently unable to grab any bullish traction after the Fed announced a USD250 billion plan to buy US corporate bonds, while US President Donald Trump is said to be to announcing a fresh USD1 trillion infrastructure plan to help boost the economy.$$$$The June ZEW indicator of Economic Sentiment in Germany pushed higher for the third month in a row, while the Current Conditions indicator rose for the first time since January. The Euro-Zone Economic Sentiment indicator also jumped higher in June.$$$$Commentating on the German data, ZEW President Professor Achim Wambach noted that there was growing confidence that the economy ‘will bottom out by summer 2020’ while survey respondents expect ‘only a slow increase in economic activity in the third and fourth quarter’. $$$$Ahead, the latest look at US consumer spending habits which are expected to show a sharp pick-up from last month. Month-on-month US retail sales are forecast to rise by 8% in May compared to a contraction of 16.4% in April. Annual sales are expected to turn further negative after last month’s -21.6% outturn. $$$$Fed chair Jerome Powell will give his semi-annual testimony to Congress later today and is likely to be quizzed about the state of the US economy and the central bank’s latest bond buying announcement.$$$$EUR/USD pushed higher Monday after the Fed’s latest announcement and is now treading water ahead of this afternoon’s data and Fed speak. Recent lows between 1.1213 and 1.1240 should provide an area of initial support ahead of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at 1.1167. Recent highs guard the June 10 high at 1.1423, which if broken convincingly would leave the recent multi-month high at 1.1496 vulnerable.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

EUR/USD Rally Continues as Positive Euro-Zone PMI Data Provides a Boost	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/06/23/EURUSD-Rally-Continues-as-Positive-Euro-Zone-PMI-Data-Provides-a-Boost.html	1592899620	French manufacturing PMI hits a 21-month high.$$$$EUR/USD respects technical support and eyes resistance.	The latest set of Markit PMI releases for June show economic activity picking up in the Euro-Zone as a loosening of lockdown conditions boosts economic activity. The French releases all pushed back above the 50 level, the divide between contraction and expansion, with the manufacturing index hitting its highest level in 21-months. The German data, while rebounding from April’s low, points to activity growing but at a more subdued rate with ‘firms starting to feel a bit more bullish about the outlook’ although concerns about the jobs market remain. According to IHS Markit, the flash Euro-Zone PMIs indicated ‘another substantial easing of the region’s downturn in June ‘ and while output and demand are still falling they are no longer collapsing.$$$$According to chief business economist Chris Williamson, ‘However, with the timing of a return to normal still something that can only be speculated upon, and virus-related restrictions likely to continue to hit many businesses for the rest of the year, we remain very cautious of the strength and sustainability of any economic rebound’.$$$$EUR/USD continues Monday’s push higher and this week’s move has broken a series of lower highs and lower lows that weighed on the pair. EUR/USD also produced a textbook bounce of the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level around 1.1167 and this is likely to provide support again in the case of any sell-off. Chart resistance levels are seen around 1.1353 and 1.1400 before the June 10 multi-week high at 1.1423 comes into view.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

British Pound (GBP) Latest: GBP/USD Bullish After Positive UK PMIs	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/06/23/British-Pound-GBP-Latest-GBPUSD-Bullish-After-Positive-UK-PMIs-MSE.html	1592904600	The UK PMIs for June all came in higher than economists were expecting, with the manufacturing index just above the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction.$$$$That has improved the outlook for GBP/USD and the GBP crosses even though GBP/USD eased back marginally after the data.$$$$Earlier, the pair was given a modest boost when the White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the US-China phase one trade pact remains in place after earlier saying it was “over”.$$$$Technically, a bull flag has developed on the GBP/USD chart, suggesting a high-volume breakout to the upside, continuing the previous trend higher.	The outlook for GBP/USD has improved after news that the “flash” purchasing managers’ indexes for the UK economy in June all rose by more than expected, with the manufacturing index just creeping above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.$$$$The PMIs were all at their highest levels for four months as some of the coronavirus lockdowns were eased. This prompted IHS Markit, which compiles the data, to note: “Looking ahead, manufacturers indicated a rise in business optimism to its highest since September 2018. Expectations of higher output in the next 12 months reflected hopes of a sustained recovery in manufacturing operations from the slump in production volumes seen during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic.”$$$$The IHS forecasting team expects the UK economy to contract by 11.9% this year before expanding by a relatively modest 4.9% in 2021, which is far more cautious than the 15% surge anticipated in 2021 by the Bank of England.$$$$Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)$$$$Prior to the UK numbers, the June PMIs for France, Germany and the Eurozone as a whole all exceeded the consensus forecasts of the economists polled by the news agencies. The French data stood out in particular, with the manufacturing, services and composite PMIs all climbing back above the 50 mark that suggests expansion rather than contraction. $$$$Earlier, GBP/USD was given a very modest boost by an improvement in risk appetite in the markets as a whole. They were taken aback when Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, said the US-China phase one trade pact was over – only to rally when he reversed position, saying the deal “continues in place”. This was backed by US President Donald Trump, who tweeted that it is still “fully intact”.$$$$Turning to the technical position, as the chart above shows a bull flag has developed in GBP/USD. This suggests a continuation of the previous upward trend, with a high-volume breakout likely to the upside. A similar bull flag has developed on the EUR/USD chart and that price already shows signs of an upside break.$$$$Like to know how to trade a bullish flag pattern?

Euro Price Outlook: EUR/USD Jumps from Key Chart Support	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/07/01/Euro-Price-Outlook-JS-EUR-USD-EURUSD-Jumps-from-Key-Chart-Support.html	1593618420	EUR/USD spent the bulk of Q2 in a range-bound state, following a riveting outlay in Q1. $$$$Through the month of June, EUR/USD has repeatedly tested a confluent spot of support on the chart. $$$$As yet, bulls have yet to give in as prices have begun Q3 with a jump off of that zone. 	Coming into the month of June, it appeared as though a trend may begin to take hold in EUR/USD. After spending the bulk of the first two months of Q2 in a range-bound state, buyers took control while driving the pair from a low below the price of 1.0900 up to a high above the 1.1400 level. This consistent topside run made a fast approach at a huge zone of resistance; but buyers pulled up shy and prices began to pullback in the first-half of the month. $$$$That pullback found buyers at a key point on the chart; this area runs from a batch of confluent Fibonacci levels plotted from 1.1187-1.1212. The latter of those levels is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the lifetime move in EUR/USD, taking the 2001 low up to the 2008 high. The former of those levels is the 61.8% retracement of the 2017-2018 major move. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview.$$$$The big question at this point is whether buyers can take control for long enough to bring upon a re-test of the key resistance zone at 1.1448-1.1500. This zone is comprised of both the 50% marker of the 2017-2018 major move, as well as the 1.1500 psychological level that bulls didn’t want to encroach upon during the March run. $$$$Since topping-out in early-June, EUR/USD bulls have been thwarted at a series of lower-highs; and that frequency has increased over the past week, as illustrated by a series of bearish trendlines. On the chart below are two bearish trendlines: In red, we have a trendline produced from the June 10th and June 23rd swing highs. This projection aligns with the approximate 1.1292, which would make it confluent with 23.6% retracement of the May-June major move. In maroon, however, is a shorter-term bearish trendline, that’s already being tested through with this morning’s price action; and that’s simply connecting last week’s swing high to this week’s swing high. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; EUR/USD on Tradingview.$$$$As we open deeper into the second-half of the year, the big question is whether buyers can stage anything more than a short-term rally. Given the series of risk events on the horizon, it’s likely to imagine that continued volatility will remain at play. $$$$For the bullish side of the pair, the near-term strength seen in the first day of Q3 trade will be key, looking for buyers to continue pushing from this very key spot of support. Should buyers retain control, the next major area of resistance would be the same that turned around the March advance, running from 1.1448-1.5000. $$$$On the bearish side of the matter, and given recent stimuli, it appears that some risk aversion may be in order. This could entail a push back towards the 1.1000 handle, and should price action hold resistance around that confluent spot of 1.1292, then the potential for a descending triangle break may remain in the cards. The descending triangle will often be approached with the aim of bearish breakouts, looking for the same motivation that’s brought in bears at lower highs to, eventually, take over to allow for a break through horizontal support. This is one of the many chart formations that are investigated in the DailyFX Education course. The stakes may seem raised here given the nature of this bigger picture support that remains in play. $$$$From an IGCS point of view, retail traders are currently heavily short in the pair, with 63% of traders currently holding bearish positions (as of this writing). $$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.
Copper, Silver Driven By US Dollar.

Data Source – Bloomberg $$$$Commodity prices have bounced back substantially since collapsing in early March, benefiting from a combination of stabilizing fundamentals and a weak US Dollar. $$$$However, the re-imposition of lockdown measures in several states in the US, as global cases of the novel coronavirus surge past 10 million, threatens to destabilize the 3-month rally in metal prices. $$$$The negative correlation between the haven-linked US Dollar and the price of copper and silver highlights the sensitivity of commodities to overall market sentiment. $$$$In essence, positivity and certainty drive metal prices higher whilst risk aversion puts a premium on safe-haven assets, discounting the price of silver and copper.  $$$$** Note: “US Dollar Index” averages EUR/USD, JPY/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD.$$$$Source – TradingView.$$$$The 200-day moving average (1.3130) has halted a potential breakout in the US Dollar, as the haven-linked currency finally pushed higher out of the Descending Wedge pattern extending from March highs. $$$$A bullish break on the Momentum indicator could intensify buying pressure should price hold above the November high (1.3040) and could see USD claw back lost ground against its major counterparts, fuelling the decline in cycle-sensitive commodities. $$$$Should prices clear resistance at the 200-day MA (1.3130) a period of risk aversion may ensue, capping the potential upside for copper and silver prices.$$$$However, inability to hold above the November high (1.3040) could suggest a false breakout, leading USD back to the monthly low (1.2741), which could come alongside appreciation in risk-associated assets. $$$$Source – TradingView.$$$$The recovery in silver prices has been nothing short of remarkable. They have climbed as much as 58% from the 12-year low set on March 18 (11.64) to wipe out prior 2020 losses. $$$$Resistance at the 2013 downtrend proved a step too far for the dollar-sensitive metal as a fresh burst of risk aversion propelled price back to the 200-day moving average (16.88), slicing through the 12-week uptrend from the March low (11.64). $$$$Despite the temporary pullback, silver continues to remain constructive above the 78.6% Fibonacci (17.31) with a topside break of the 2020 open (17.83) and Symmetrical Triangle resistance hinting at further upside to come.$$$$Development of both technical indicators reinforce the bullish price action seen over the last week of trade as the RSI tracks its 12-week uptrend and the Momentum indicator accelerates away from 8-week support. $$$$A close above resistance at the June high (18.38) may validate the topside break of the Symmetrical Triangle pattern, leading to price possibly accelerating through the February high (18.94) to an implied measured-move objective just shy of the psychologically imposing 20-handle (19.61).$$$$However, the metal’s sensitivity to the US Dollar may ultimately cap gains as the weakening fundamental backdrop may result in a surge of risk aversion, putting a premium on the haven-associated Greenback and discounting sentiment-sensitive commodities such as silver. $$$$To that end, failure of price to hold above the 2020 open (17.83) could intensify selling pressure, resulting in a sharp decline back to supportive regions at the 78.6% (17.31) and 23.6% Fibonacci’s (16.79). $$$$Source – TradingView $$$$Although copper has recovered substantially from its lowest levels since 2016, the brown metal has continued to lag its silver and gold counterparts, as the continued climb in global coronavirus cases dampens the outlook for global growth. $$$$Despite the fragility of the economic recovery copper prices continue to track within an ascending channel, that has supported the growth proxy in its 38% recovery from the yearly low (1.9671). $$$$However, the divergence of both the RSI and Momentum indicators with price highlight a degree of exhaustion in the recent rally from the 200-day moving average (2.5521) as copper approaches key resistance levels at the November 2019 high (2.7268) and 2020 open (2.7793).$$$$Immediate short-term direction may be dictated by the RSI as it flirts with overbought territory for the second time this year. Failure of the oscillator to jump back above 70 could signal a potential pullback to the convergence of channel support and the 78.6% Fibonacci (2.679).$$$$With the February high (2.6262) acting as the line in the sand for would-be buyers, a close below may signal a resumption of the primary downtrend with key downside hurdles falling at the 200-MA (2.5521) and 61.8% Fibonacci (2.5550).  $$$$-- Written by Daniel Moss, Analyst for DailyFX.$$$$Follow me on Twitter @DanielGMoss.
EUR/USD Rally Stalls Ahead of The Latest US Jobs Report	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/07/02/EURUSD-Uptick-Stalls-Ahead-of-The-Latest-US-Jobs-Report.html	1593689100	EURUSD pushing ahead but traders are moving to the sidelines ahead of the US NFP release.$$$$Last month’s US Labor Report saw a bewildering 2.5 million jobs added to the economy.	Last month’s US nonfarm payroll report stunned the market with 2.5 million jobs added to the payroll compared to forecasts of around 7.5 million employees losing their jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 13.3% from a prior 14.7% in April, smashing expectations that the rate would touch 20%. Today’s report is forecast to show that 3 million jobs have been added, helping to lower the unemployment rate to 12.3%. A caveat to last month’s figures came in the BLS report which showed that due to potential miscalculation errors, the unemployment rate may have been three percentage points higher. Today’s report may shock as well and close attention should be paid to any revisions to last month’s numbers.$$$$Today’s Eurozone unemployment rate came in better than expected at 7.4% compared to estimates of 7.7%, while this week’s final Eurozone manufacturing PMI also beat the flash estimate – 47.4 compared to 46.9. Recent better-than-expected data has underpinned the single currency but the upside remains limited until the Eurozone recovery fund gets given the green light by all member states. $$$$EURUSD has picked up from yesterday’s low around 1.1185 and touched 1.1300 earlier today before nudging lower. The monthly low around 1.1168 may come under pressure if the NFP report beats and boosts the US dollar, especially if the lower swing highs made this month remain unbroken. If the pair are to push higher then 1.1350 needs to be broken to allow another run at the 1.1424 multi-month high made on June 10. $$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

US Dollar Price Action Set for Non-Farm Payrolls	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/07/02/US-Dollar-Price-Action-Set-for-Non-Farm-Payrolls.html	1593682320	US Dollar Eyes Non-Farm Payrolls Storm.$$$$Revisions Matter for NFP.	Today will largely center around the US NFP report, which is a day earlier than usual given the Independence Day market holiday. Expectations are for 3mln jobs to have been created for June with the unemployment rate to have dropped 1ppt to 12.3%. However, while a figure of 3mln would mark a record monthly gain, this is far from signalling a “V” shaped recovery as figure 1 shows. $$$$DailyFX NFP Webinar.$$$$Another aspect to keep in mind is that there is a wide range of estimates with a high/low range of 9mln to 405k further emphasising the uncertainty around this data point, which has been skewed by furlough schemes. That said, a weaker employment report would likely have a larger impact than a better than expected release. Elsewhere, the focus will also be on revisions, after yesterday’s ADP report showed a 5mln revision higher from the prior month, however, markets will be placing a close eye on the unemployment figure, given that the BLS noted that the unemployment rate may have perhaps been 3ppts higher than reported.$$$$To the detriment of the US Dollar, the pick-up in risk appetite has kept the US Dollar on the back-foot ahead of the US jobs report. Selling in the greenback may be exacerbated on a firm jobs report, thus allowing for EUR/USD to make a topside breach of 1.13 with GBP/USD extending on the recent 2% gains. However, with estimates skewed for gains, a softer than expected figure by quite some margin could provide a renewed bid in the greenback as risk sentiment stalls.$$$$Source: IG.
US Dollar, Gold Price, S&P 500 React to June 2020 Jobs Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/07/02/us-dollar-gold-price-sp500-react-to-june-2020-jobs-data.html	1593693000	US Dollar remains under pressure with the DXY Index trading about 0.25% lower on balance immediately after the monthly nonfarm payrolls and weekly jobless claims data release.$$$$Gold price action tumbled by about 0.5% in the run-up to the employment figures and the precious metal is currently trading near session lows $$$$S&P 500 Index futures extended higher toward the 3,140-price level as Wall Street continues to advance despite mixed labor market figures and rising coronavirus second wave risk.	Monthly nonfarm payrolls for June and weekly jobless claims for the week ended 27-June just crossed the wires and look to dominate market headlines for Thursday’s trading session. According to the DailyFX Economic Calendar, the headline net change in NFPs was reported at 4.8-million jobs added, which topped the median economist estimate looking for 3.0-million, and compares to the prior reading of 2.5-million.  $$$$Initial claims disappointed, however, with the actual reading missing the market consensus. Continuing claims still show about 20-million Americans filing for unemployment insurance amid the lingering coronavirus pandemic.$$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$The US Dollar Index – a basket of major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY – had an adverse knee-jerk reaction right when the jobs data dropped. This is likely explained by the US Dollar’s posturing as a top safe-haven currency. Added downward pressure likely came in response to the monthly jobs report, which also detailed the unemployment rate ticking lower from 13.3% to 11.1%. $$$$The US Dollar has since pivoted back higher, however, and currently trades back above the 97.00-handle at the time of writing. Perhaps the whipsawed-response is owed to the far-less rosy jobless claims data reported weekly and thus regarded as more of a ‘leading’ indicator relative to NFPs. $$$$Read More – NFP: Nonfarm Payrolls Drives the US Dollar & Currency Volatility.$$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$The price of gold continues to edge lower following the double-whammy jobs data release. Gold prices have pivoted nearly 2% below the precious metal’s year-to-date high printed earlier this week as the commodity flirts with a massive technical resistance level. That said, gold price action hovers around $1,760/oz and is an area of confluence that has recently provided buoyancy to bullion. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$As for equities, the US stock market looks set to open higher largely thanks to unwavering investor risk appetite and an abundance of liquidity. According to the NFP report, “The number of unemployed persons who were on temporary layoff decreased by 4.8 million in June to 10.6 million, following a decline of 2.7 million in May. The number of permanent job losers continued to rise, increasing by 588,000 to 2.9 million in June.” Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus cases continue to rise as the pandemic persists. $$$$This has caused another wave of Apple Inc store closures as businesses shutter and governments back-track on reopening guidelines. Not to mention, ongoing China tension remains a threat to stock market outlook. Alas, with global officials pumping up stocks and investor confidence, the risk of equities becoming increasingly detached from their economic fundamentals seems to have grown exponentially. Complacency has ballooned alongside the Federal Reserve balance sheet, which has widely contributed to unwavering risk appetite, and led some market participants to incorrectly believe the troubling and misleading mantra that “stocks only got up.” To be clear, stocks can, and eventually do, go down.$$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

A host of market worries could potentially benefit the safe-haven US Dollar near-term, leaving EUR/USD at risk of breaking below trendline support that has been in place for almost two months. Since then, the pair has traded around the 1.09 mark but a break below 1.08 would likely lead to further losses.$$$$Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)$$$$Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is due to talk at 1300 GMT on current economic conditions and his speech could prove a catalyst for the drop in EUR/USD following US President Donald Trump’s call for negative US interest rates. Powell seems likely to push back on that idea but negative rates remain a possibility, with market pricing suggesting they could come as early as the start of next year.$$$$You can find out here how central banks impact the forex market.$$$$In addition, the safe-haven USD will likely benefit from an escalation of US-China trade tensions and growing fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections.

According to the latest ECB survey, the Euro Area economy will contract by 5.5% in Q1, sharply lower than last quarters report when the block was expected to grow by 1.1% this year. Today’s report also showed a sharp bounce in 2021 GDP growth to 4.3% from 1.2%, driven higher by the impact of ‘mitigation measures’. The survey also showed unemployment rising to 9.4% this year from 7.5%, while inflation is expected to fall to 0.8% from 1.2% in the Q1 report.$$$$Results of the Q2 2020 ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters.$$$$The Euro Area Markit manufacturing PMI final released earlier today just missed last week’s preliminary reading, printing at 33.4 versus 33.6 and 44.5 in March. According to data provider Markit, output, new orders, export sales and purchasing activity ‘all fell at record rates, whilst supply side constraints intensified to an unprecedented extent. Confidence about the future sank to a fresh series low’. German factory orders (March) are released on Wednesday at 07:00 UK and are expected to slump to -10.0% from -1.4% in February.$$$$For all market moving data and events please see the DailyFX calendar.$$$$The Euro continues to slip lower after touching a 1.1018 one-month high last Thursday. Last week’s rally was driven by month-end portfolio rebalancing with strong demand for the Euro and notable USD sellers. The 200-dma also acted as resistance to the rally and looks likely to stem any further attempt at the upside. EUR/USD has also broken back below the 50-dma and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.0965. A cluster of old highs and the 20-dma between 1.0910 and 1.0882 should act as preliminary support.  $$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

Today’s ruling by the German Constitutional Court that ECB QE was legal came with a caveat that hit the single currency lower.

The ECB survey of professional forecasters yesterday showed euro-area growth contracting by 5.5% in 2020.$$$$Keep Up To Date With All Market Moving Economic Releases With The DailyFX Calendar.$$$$The British Pound (GBP) on the other hand has remained stable to marginally better-bid Tuesday, as talk continues to swirl of a gradual unwinding of current lockdown conditions being announced later this week, following similar announcements in Europe.$$$$EUR/GBP has traded in a two-point range over the last five weeks with little in the way of news to break either boundary. This may change now with EUR/GBP currently pressing down on channel support after having broken below both the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 0.8747 and the 20-dma at 0.8736 earlier in the session. A break below 0.8678 and last Thursday’s 0.8670 would expose the 200-dma at 0.8653. Monday’s high print at 0.8815 should now cap any short-term upside.

EUR/USD continues to try and mount a rally from the long-term trend-line extending back to 1985 if you rebuild the euro prior to its existence from its current constituents. Even without it the line is 20 years old. Either way it is big, and the fact the Euro can’t trade off it is a significant warning sign.$$$$Given the way it has been acting if the line is to break it shouldn’t be too long from now before it does so. The level to watch is 10635, the March low. A break below there should start to give EUR/USD some separation with the January 2017 low at 10340 up next as support, and then finally parity could be reached. The thinking is the Euro could go much lower, but we’ll take it one step at a time.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$USD/CAD hasn’t been acting as many have expected given the extreme volatility in the oil market, but overall the price action still smacks of corrective since the Q1 surge. The back-and-forth grind lower suggests buyers at every step of the way. In April 13850/55 marked two lows. This will be used in the near-term as a guide. $$$$The result of the decline off the March high may be a wedge, which once fully built and triggered could lead to another surge in price towards the 14600 area that stalled the last rally. The feeling is on this end that at some point that will be hurdled and a move to the 16000 area will develop.

The single currency continues to move lower after the German Constitutional Court ruled on Tuesday that the ECB’s bond buying scheme (QE) was not balanced and gave the central bank three months to prove that the QE program was ‘proportionate’ otherwise the Bundesbank may pull out of the program. Subsequent commentary from the President of the Bundesbank Jens Weidmann that he would support the ECB in their efforts to meet this requirement calmed the situation but if the market sees any fractures within the EU, the Euro will come under increasing pressure. $$$$EUR/USD Hit as Germany Rules That ECB Actions are Against EU Treaty.$$$$Tuesday’s EUR/USD sell-off continues this morning after data showed German Factory orders slumping in March. According to the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), the real (price-adjusted) order intake in March 2020 was 15.6% lower than in February 2020, seasonally and calendar-adjusted, the largest decrease since the beginning of the time series in January 1991.Compared to February, domestic orders fell 14.8%, international orders slumped 16.1% and orders from the Euro-Zone fell by 17.9%.$$$$For all market moving data and events please see the DailyFX calendar.$$$$EURUSD has now broken below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.0839 again and a cluster of recent lows around 1.0810.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) has been hacking around for the past five weeks making no headway in either direction. It has been somewhat frustrating to watch, but with a little more time it is likely that this all sorts itself out.$$$$Right now the range for the DXY is set from 98.27 up to 100.93. The support level from late March is in confluence with the 200-day MA, so it is sturdy. The resistance level was obtained on a couple of occasions during April. Once we get out of the range we should be able to run with a clear trading bias.$$$$DXY Chart by TradingView.$$$$We have spent a lot of time recently discussing the 35-year trend-line in EUR/USD, and rightfully so – it’s 35-yrs old! That is, when reconstructing the Euro before its existence from the constituents that make it up now. So far the Euro is finding little life at this massive level of support. For now though it is indeed support with the 10635 level as the critical level to watch. How things play out here will be very important for the Dollar as the Euro accounts for roughly 57% of the DXY index.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$USD/JPY posted a nice descending wedge not long ago, then finally broke. But the spill from the pattern has highlighted the return of low volatility in FX and has been a bit of a disappointment as such. But nevertheless the pair is still heading downhill and unless it can trade above 10750 the outlook is set to remain neutral to bearish.$$$$USD/JPY Chart by TradingView.$$$$For all the charts we looked at, check out the video above…$$$$Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, DailyFX has several resources available to help you; indicator for tracking trader sentiment, quarterly trading forecasts, analytical and educational webinars held daily, and trading guides to help you improve trading performance. $$$$---Written by Paul Robinson, Market Analyst.$$$$You can follow Paul on Twitter at @PaulRobinsonFX.

The German R rate rose above 1 at the start of the week, before dropping back to 0.94 late Tuesday, both noticeably higher than last Wednesday’s figure of 0.65. German Chancellor Angela Merkel eased lockdown restrictions last week, adding that the ‘first phase of the pandemic is behind us’. If the R rate returns back above 1 for any period of time, then the German Chancellor may be forced to change tack.$$$$ *** Please Note Time Changes for Data Releases ***$$$$On Friday’s economic calendar, two important releases stand out and are likely to determine the short-term future of EUR/USD. German preliminary Q1 GDP is released at 09:00 UK and is expected to show a sharp q/q contraction in growth – to -2.2% from a prior quarter’s 0%. – while at 10:00 UK  the Euro Area figure is expected to be even worse at -3.8% against a previous reading of 0.1%. If these figures fail to meet even these lowly expectations, the pressure on the Euro will increase further. $$$$EURUSD continues to re-test recent lows and is back below all three moving averages again. A cluster of old lows down to 1.0766 guard the April 24 low at 1.0727 before the March 22 three-year low at 1.0636 comes into view.

Upcoming GDP figures out of Germany, and the larger encompassing Euro Area, set to cross the wires on Friday will provide traders with more data to digest over the coming weekend.

Conforming to the larger trend in risk aversion seen in equites, EUR/USD weakened as the safe-haven US Dollar edged higher following Powell’s apprehension toward negative interest rates in the United States. $$$$Bears are back in control following last week’s bullish performance in the Euro Stoxx 50 index.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) continues to trade within the confines of a range, which is making the immediate moment difficult for many traders. Times like this require patience if looking for directional moves. If flipping within the range then this is fertile ground. It’s all a turn of perspective. The top of the range clocks in at 100.93 while the bottom of the range rings in at 98.27, just below the slightly rising 200-day MA.$$$$DXY Chart by TradingView.$$$$Again we will talk about the massive long-term trend-line in EUR/USD. Taking the Euro back before its existence and building it from its constituents gives you price action back to when currencies began to float freely in the 1970s. There is a trend-line from 1985 passing under the 2000 low and more recently the March low. This makes the March low of 10635 one of the biggest levels in all of FX, and financial markets for that matter. A break below should have a larger swing lower in play, but until it breaks it should continue to be respected as support. The lack of buying at the threshold, though, is further increasing the likelihood that trust in support is wearing thin.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$GBP/USD, like other pairs, has been bound up by directionless price action. Overall it is drifting lower at the moment, but should start to light up a bit here soon once FX starts to move again.

Euro Latest - EUR/USD Rally Continues, Mixed German ZEW Readings	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/05/19/Euro-Latest-EURUSD-Rally-Continues-Mixed-German-ZEW-Readings.html	1589880600	Mixed messages from ZEW data as economic sentiment jumps.$$$$EUR/USD nears a fresh two-week high.	The latest German ZEW data produced a mixed set of readings with economic sentiment soaring while the assessment of the current economic conditions continued to fall. The May economic sentiment index jumped to a five-year high of 51 versus expectations of 32 and a prior reading of 28.2, while the current conditions index fell to -93.5 compared to expectations of -88 and a prior -91.5. The Euro-Zone sentiment index rose to 46 from a 25.2 in April. $$$$Commenting on the release, ZEW President Professor Achim Wambach said,  $$$$“Optimism is growing that there will be an economic turnaround from summer onwards. This is also reflected in the significant improvement in expectations for the individual sectors. According to the financial market experts surveyed, economic growth is expected to pick up pace again in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, the catching-up process will take a long time. Only in 2022 will economic output return to the level of 2019,”$$$$The proposed EUR500 billion rescue fund announced yesterday gave the single currency a boost and helped lower government bond yields on the countries most hit by the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus. The fund will provide grants, not loans, to the countries most in need and will be funded by a set repayment plan provided for by future EU budgets. The plan, proposed by EU-heavyweights Germany and France, may still run into objections from certain EU member states, including Austria and the Netherlands, who believe that the rescue fund should provide loans and not grants to other EU countries. The French Finance Minister recently said that this proposed fund will probably not be available until 2021 which may be too late for some EU members.$$$$EURUSD is nudging levels last seen two weeks ago, helped by yesterday’s announcement, and is approaching a cluster of resistance levels. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.0965 is currently under pressure, ahead of the 200-dma at 1.1012 and the May 1 multi-week high at 1.1018. A close above here would expose the 50% Fibonacci level at 1.1066. A cluster of old lows protect 1.0764.$$$$What is your view on EUR/USD – bullish or bearish??

Correspondingly, spot EUR/USD price action surged in response to hope for a breakthrough on reaching a Eurozone stimulus package. $$$$EUR/USD prices spiked higher by 125-pips on the back of broad Euro strength. The move to the upside also looks exacerbated by US Dollar weakness as risk appetite flourishes with fresh optimistic coronavirus vaccine headlines recently crossing the wires. Spot EUR/USD price action now trades slightly below the 1.0920 level and rides the upper boundary of its 3-standard deviation Bollinger Band on an hourly candlestick chart. $$$$The explosion higher in EUR/USD off the 1.0800 price – a critical support zone zone of confluent support – rocketed the major currency pair back above its 50-day moving average for the first time since May 03. EUR/USD strength in response to the Eurobond recovery bond headlines could propel spot prices toward the 1.1000 handle and month-to-date highs. $$$$EUR/USD might find technical resistance around this area underpinned by the 200-day moving average. Moreover, a noteworthy series of lower highs recorded by EUR/USD prices since mid-March could hinder a prolonged advance by the Euro against its US Dollar peer. $$$$Spot EUR/USD also faces fundamental headwinds from improving US Dollar outlook as the Fed says no to NIRP and China tension flares. Likewise, there is potential that recent strength shown by EUR price action may fail to find follow-through, which is considering potential pushback from certain EU nations, like the Netherlands, who are reluctant on having to ‘foot the bill’ for a Euro recovery fund. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

It is rising now and trying to break above the March 27 high at 11147. It is difficult to trust a EUR/USD rally these days since it has not held onto one for very long since topping back in early 2018. Should it hang onto recent gains without immediately retrenching and the DXY stays below the range, then we may be on to a larger move.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$Gold has a short-term bullish set-up that may play nicely with USD weakening. The longer and shorter-term path of least resistance remains higher. There is a choppy declining channel (bull-flag-like) that gold is trying to pop out of.

The ECB may well pick up the Bundesbank’s PSPP commitments if a German court rules that the current quantitative program is not legal and appropriate. According to a Reuters report, the ECB would take up the Bundesbank’s PSPP allotment and in a worst-case scenario also launch legal action against the German central bank to bring it back into the fold. While there is a possibility or one or both of these actions occurring, it is likely that the Bundesbank will prove to the German court that the ECB’s actions are appropriate. If however the German court rule against additional bond buying, the Euro would come under heavy pressure and talk of the demise of the single currency would increase. The German court ruling is expected in early August. $$$$A positive risk backdrop Tuesday helped push EUR/USD back towards 1.1000 and levels last seen in late-March. Risk sentiment has been buoyed by the gradual unwind of COVID-19 lockdowns across Europe, falling fatality and infection rates and reports of various ongoing drug trials.$$$$EUR/USD has rallied the best part of one big figure so far today and nears important resistance around the 1.1000/1.1020 area. If the pair are going to move higher still, they will need to break 1.1000 big figure resistance, the 200-day moving average at 1.1010 and two recent highs just below 1.1010 and 1.1020. Above here lies the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent sell-off at 1.1066.

Spot EUR/USD just extended its rally for the fourth-consecutive trading session and sent the major currency pair to its strongest reading in eight weeks. The proposed EU recovery fund, which would extend €500 billion in grants and €250 billion in loans, stands out as a primary driver of Euro gains. $$$$A marked rise in the German Bund to Italian BTP spread underscores this prospect of symbolic EU action and likely contributes to advancing EUR/USD price action. Moreover, Euro strength also seems exacerbated in part by broad US Dollar weakness as demand for safe-haven currencies fades and unwavering risk appetite crushes volatility. $$$$EUR/USD now trades comfortably above its 200-day moving average again after a 300-pip rally in spot prices since the potential EU stimulus package was first announced on May 18. Also, after eclipsing technical resistance posed by the 1.1000 price level, Euro bulls might attempt to make another push higher and possibly look toward the March 27 swing high as an upside objective. $$$$On the other hand, EUR/USD prices are probing the upper Bollinger Band, which, statistically speaking, could facilitate a mean-reversion lower. Likewise, rising China tension threatens to rekindle US Dollar demand and spark a reversal in spot EUR/USD. A breakdown in negotiations over the €750 billion recovery fund proposal – a material possibility in light of opposition voiced by relatively more frugal European counties – could similarly cause EUR/USD price action to pivot sharply lower. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

The Euro has strengthened considerably over the last two trading sessions. EUR price action since Thursday has largely dominated the direction of major currency pairs. Upside recently recorded by the Euro against its USD, GBP, CAD and AUD peers seems driven mostly by market participants reacting to the latest European Central Bank update. $$$$Euro bulls have rejoiced expanded ECB measures set forth to counter a slump in the Eurozone economy, which has deepened exponentially over the last three months amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Euro Currency Index now trades about 1.5% higher since the March 28 close and broadly reflects the advance printed by EUR/USD price action, as well as the jump in EUR/GBP, EUR/CAD and EUR/AUD. That said, on the back of the ECB meeting, can Euro strength continue as traders turn their calendars to the new month? $$$$EUR/USD upward momentum has accelerated over the last two days and is reflected by bullish divergence on the MACD indicator. The Euro spiked by about 130-pips against its US Dollar peer as EUR/USD, arguably the most popular currency pair, attempts to rebound from three-year lows. $$$$The bounce-back attempt by the Euro may prove short-lived, however, considering it is likely that demand for safe-haven currencies, such as the US Dollar, may resurface and spark another aggressive selloff in spot EUR/USD price action. $$$$EUR/GBP price action is rocketing higher as the Euro catches bid against the Pound Sterling near a huge level of confluence noted by the 200-day exponential moving average around the 0.8700 handle. This area of technical support could continue bolstering spot EUR/GBP going forward. At the same time, technical resistance highlighted by the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the latest bearish leg could hinder a protracted advance.$$$$Euro outlook against the Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar also hints at potential for further strength. After probing a critical technical support level outlined in this Canadian Dollar forecast, EUR/CAD has exploded since last Wednesday as the Euro rockets higher. Spot EUR/CAD could continue climbing in light of recent dovish commentary from the Bank of Canada, which adds to downside risk facing CAD price action due to crude oil demand woes. $$$$EUR/AUD shows potential to extend its advance as well, particularly in consideration of this Australian Dollar forecast, which outlines major fundamental threats faced by the pro-risk Aussie. On that note, spot EUR/AUD price action looks like it may have already begun a topside breakout after eclipsing its bearish trendline extended through the series of higher lows since mid-March. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

A resurgent US dollar and ongoing worries over EU harmony in the face of the coronavirus has seen the pair move notably lower in one-way trade. The 20-dma and 50-dma are now active with the short-term moving average (1.0935) now broken while the medium-term dma (1.0982) provided solid resistance for a second day in a row. The daily chart shows the series of higher-lows being broken adding to the downside pressure on the pair. With prices seemingly capped just under 1.1000, lower prices are looking increasingly likely going forward.$$$$The uptick in the value of the US dollar has put pressure on the pair while ongoing concerns that the EU is finding difficulty in establishing a common stance how to counter the economic damage caused by coronavirus is also contributing to EUR/USD weakness. Later today in the US, the monthly advanced retail sales data (March) will be released with expectations for a -8.0% print against last month’s -0.5%. Economic data for March is fully expected to be sharply lower than February’s readings as the impact of coronavirus is laid bare.

US dollar traders will be watching both releases for any deviation from market forecasts.  $$$$For all market moving data and events please the DailyFX calendar.$$$$What is your view on EURUSD – bullish or bearish??

EUR/USD, USD Index & More – Charts for Next Week	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/04/17/EURUSD-USD-Index-More-Charts-for-Next-Week-PRtech.html	1587126600	EUR/USD little lift off major long-term trend-line.$$$$DXY could be gearing up for another run soon.	The Euro continues to tread on a very important long-term trend-line that rises up from as far back at 1985 when reconstructing it with the current constituents’ currencies pre-Euro. It is a big line indeed, and so far it being held, but not exactly in a way that invokes confidence from the long-side. The repeated failed attempts to rally are getting smaller and suggest that a breakdown could happen very soon. The price action is coiling up and on that a break below 10768 will likely have EUR/USD rolling towards the March low at 10637, which if broken could spell serious trouble as the single currency tries to leave behind the multi-decade support line.$$$$EUR/USD Charts by TradingView.$$$$The US Dollar Index (DXY) is largely driven by the Euro as it accounts for ~57% of the index. On that, if the Euro does indeed break the major long-term trend-line then we would see a significant lift in the index. The current price action suggests a base is forming, and with the general trend higher over the years it appears likely it will in some fashion continue higher. There is support right around 98.20 via a late-March low and the 200-day MA in confluence. The first level of resistance clocks in at 100.93. Perhaps price bobbles around a bit before moving, but if one side or the other breaks momentum could pick up. $$$$US Dollar Index (DXY) Chart by TradingView.$$$$For all the charts we looked at, check out the video above…$$$$Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, DailyFX has several resources available to help you; indicator for tracking trader sentiment, quarterly trading forecasts, analytical and educational webinars held daily, and trading guides to help you improve trading performance. $$$$We also have a series of guides for those looking to trade specific markets, such as the S&P 500, Dow, DAX, gold, silver, crude oil, and copper.$$$$---Written by Paul Robinson, Market Analyst.$$$$You can follow Paul on Twitter at @PaulRobinsonFX.

The latest German ZEW data showing sentiment picking up in the largest Euro-Zone member, jumping to 28.2 from a prior reading of -49.5 in March and expectations of -42.3. The current situation reading however fell further to -91.5 compared to a prior -43.1 and a forecast of -75. $$$$“The financial market experts are beginning to see a light at the end of the very long tunnel. The results of the special questions on the coronavirus crisis included in the survey show that the experts do not expect to see positive economic growth until the third quarter of 2020. Economic output is not expected to return to pre-corona levels before 2022,” wrote ZEW president Professor Achim Wambach. $$$$ZEW Press Release.$$$$On Wednesday this week, the latest Euro-Zone Consumer Confidence data for April will be released at 14:00 GMT with markets forecasting a fall to minus 20 compared to a prior reading of -11.6. On Thursday, the closely watched Markit PMIs will be released and are expected to show further losses. The March Euro-Zone Composite PMI reading recorded its biggest ever single monthly fall to hit a survey record low of 29.7 and Thursday’s preliminary April reading is forecast to hit 25.9. $$$$For all market moving data and events please the DailyFX calendar.$$$$The Euro remains weak and currently trades around 1.0840 against the US dollar. The 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.0839 is now in play and a break and close below here would open up the April 6 swing low at 1.0768 ahead of the multi-year low at 1.0636.

The Euro has been largely directionless the past few weeks, with the range contracting into a wedge pattern. The good news about this is that it means a move is likely to develop soon as lower volatility gives way to higher volatility. EUR/USD remains precariously positioned on the trend-line extending up from 1985 (using the constituents currency prices). It is very long-term in nature and thus needs to be given some room. The line needs to be drawn with a crayon, not a fine-point pencil. With that said, a break below 10636 (March low) is seen as a trigger for getting some separation from the line on the downside. On the flip-side, we still can’t rule out that despite the weak attempts to rally so far, that the Euro isn’t building a base to run higher. A break of the wedge and trade above 10991 is seen as getting momentum turned towards higher levels.$$$$EUR/USD Charts by TradingView.$$$$USD/JPY appears to working on a descending wedge, which given the context of it developing after a thrust off a swing-high suggests we could see a breakdown soon. The 10692 level is critical here as it was tagged to the pip twice this month. A rally could certainly develop, but at this time a breakdown is seen as the “easier” path to trade. If we do get a breakdown, the broader trend is not clear, but a move to the 104 area seems reasonable given current levels of volatility. $$$$USD/JPY Chart by TradingView.$$$$For all the charts we looked at, check out the video above…$$$$Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, DailyFX has several resources available to help you; indicator for tracking trader sentiment, quarterly trading forecasts, analytical and educational webinars held daily, and trading guides to help you improve trading performance. $$$$We also have a series of guides for those looking to trade specific markets, such as the S&P 500, Dow, DAX, gold, silver, crude oil, and copper.$$$$---Written by Paul Robinson, Market Analyst.$$$$You can follow Paul on Twitter at @PaulRobinsonFX.

The services PMI should be closely followed after both the EU and UK readings cratered to record lows of 11.7 (26.4 prior) and 12.3 (36.0 prior) respectively. The initial jobless claims figure is forecast at 4.5 million for the week ending April 18.

The 20-day moving average is adding weight to support, while a close above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at 100.37 would likely open a re-test of the April 6 high at 101.04. Above here, the DXY would likely eye 101.74 in the short- to medium-term.

A breakdown below 13996 would not be good though and likely lead to a leg lower.

FED, Recession, COVID-19, Chair Powell – Talking Points:$$$$As expected, the Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as the Federal Open Market Committee’s two-day meeting concluded. Investors focused in on commentary towards liquidity facilities and the outlook on rates, which are already near zero. The Dow Jones index gave back some gains from earlier in the session as the FOMC statement crossed the wires. Still, markets remain well in green territory after Gilead provided positive news on its coronavirus vaccine. $$$$Dow Jones Index (1-Min Chart)$$$$Source: IG Charts $$$$Despite wide consensus, some speculated that the Fed will bring rates into negative territory, however, Fed Chair Powell commented back in March that it would not be an appropriate policy. Granted that, the central bank took aggressive action through quantitative easing since March as the effects of the virus pandemic surfaced. Rates will remain at 0 to 0.25 percent until it is confident that the economy is clear of the pandemic impacts according to the FOMC statement. $$$$Federal Reserve Balance Sheet.$$$$Source: federalreserve.gov.$$$$Monetary action appears successful in stemming volatility and illiquidity in credit and other financial markets, however, economic activity in the United States inevitably revealed a sharp contraction earlier Wednesday morning as GDP declined 4.8 percent in the first-quarter. Intentions of continuing the purchase of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities were stated by FOMC to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Moreover, overnight repo operations will also continue.$$$$Fed Chair Powell Comments on Monetary Policy.$$$$Chair Powell noted the harsh impact on consumer spending and other impacts to the economy in his virtual press conference following the FOMC statement. The depth and duration of the current downturn will depend on the severity of COVID-19's spread. Regarding the balance sheet, Powell noted that treasury and MBS purchases will continue as necessary. Referencing demand for the Fed's facilities, Chair Powell noted that there is an ability to extend if demand calls for it, but the Treasury still has plenty of equity. $$$$Gold Spot Price (Daily Chart)$$$$Source: IG Charts $$$$Turning to inflation, Chair Powell noted that they will keep a close eye on it when asked, but he believes it is unlikely. Nevertheless, a sharp decline in oil prices will likely have some effect on inflation moving forward and expectations in consumer surveys have ticked lower. Still, gold prices, a common hedge against inflation, remain near multi-year highs.$$$$Economic Calendar - Euro Area.$$$$Source: DailyFX.$$$$The action-packed week will continue tomorrow with the ECB rate decision.

The US Dollar declined for a fourth consecutive trading session on Wednesday. The US Dollar experienced renewed selling pressure after the FOMC rate decision crossed the wires. US Dollar downside then accelerated on the back of dovish remarks from Fed Chair Powell. $$$$The DXY Index, a basket of major currency pairs that reflects US Dollar performance broadly, trades 1.4% below its April 24 intraday high due to the ongoing stretch of US Dollar weakness. DXY Index price action now probes a critical technical support level, however, that might send the US Dollar catapulting back higher. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$US Dollar downside may soon subside with the DXY Index potentially finding buoyancy around the 99.25 to 99.50 price zone. This level of technical confluence is underpinned by its 50-day moving average and positively-sloped trendline extended through the series of higher lows since March 13. $$$$Also, despite US Dollar selling pressure throughout the session, which was exacerbated by word that Powell expects the Fed to do more in terms of its liquidity efforts to combat the likely unavoidable coronavirus recession, it is noteworthy that the DXY Index failed to take out the prior intraday low. $$$$If the US Dollar fails to find support around the aforementioned technical level, the DXY Index could stretch lower toward its next area of support near the 99.00 handle and mid-point retracement of last month’s trading range before the 200-day moving average comes into focus. $$$$EUR/USD continued its rebound since the most liquid and heavily traded currency pair plunged below 1.08 as the EU Summit failed to deliver a coordinated coronavirus stimulus response last week. The bullish MACD crossover hints at potential for a bigger advance if upward momentum gains pace and sees follow-through. $$$$Although, with the European Central Bank on deck to provide markets with its own monetary policy update, spot EUR/USD price action could whipsaw back lower. EUR/USD might reverse if the ECB meeting reveals the central bank intends on boosting its bond buying program or other increasingly accommodative monetary policy measures. $$$$US Dollar weakness is particularly evident when observing recent AUD/USD price action. Recent strength in spot AUD/USD is also indicated by the RSI climbing to its highest reading since the start of the year. $$$$That said, AUD/USD bullish continuation seems likely until coronavirus recession concerns resurface and bring safe-haven currencies, like the USD, back into demand. The broader US Dollar might remain under pressure as AUD/USD climbs or until there is a resurgence in currency volatility.  $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

However, Eurozone governments have so far proved unable to agree meaningful joint action on fiscal policy to complement it despite ECB pressure on them to come up with a sizeable reconstruction plan.$$$$This contrasts with the US, where President Donald Trump and Congress have already approved more than $4 trillion to support the medical response to Covid-19 and protect the economy from its impact – although Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and others have called for even more.$$$$How Central Banks Impact the Forex Market.$$$$--- Written by Martin Essex, Analyst and Editor.$$$$Feel free to contact me via the comments section below.

The Canadian Dollar looks like it may start to come under pressure following an impressive recovery in CAD price action over the last few weeks. Despite the 5% rally notched by the Canadian Dollar Currency Index (CXY) since its March 18 low, the Loonie still trades about 7% below its year-to-date high. Canadian Dollar weakness since January has mirrored the crude oil price crash considering the energy sector contributes roughly 10% to Canada GDP. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingVie.$$$$Crude oil prices also tend to have a material impact on inflation. Seeing that the Bank of Canada governing mandate is inflation targeting, sharp swings in crude oil can weigh considerably on BOC monetary policy decisions. On that note, aiming to offset economic turmoil that stems from the coronavirus pandemic and likely unavoidable recession, the BOC slashed target interest rates this year along with several other central banks. $$$$Learn More – CAD & Oil: Canadian Dollar and Oil Price Correlation.$$$$Downward pressure on the Loonie and Canadian economy subsided following dovish action from the BOC and OPEC+ deal that is anticipated to put a floor in crude oil. While crude oil demand woes persist and market complacency builds, however, the recent Canadian Dollar rebound may soon experience another breakdown. That said, USD/CAD and EUR/CAD price action are both responding to major technical support levels and suggests the Canadian Dollar could be on the cusp of a reversal. $$$$USD/CAD is hovering above a support zone underpinned by the 1.3800 handle. Spot USD/CAD price action has so far held its April 13 intraday low and provides a sign of encouragement for Canadian Dollar bears. Although, if USD/CAD prices attempt to extend a rebound, the 1.4000 level, which is underpinned by the 9-day and 34-day exponential moving averages, could present headwinds. $$$$EUR/CAD is also climbing as the Euro rips higher off technical support near the 1.5050 price level. Spot EUR/CAD jumped after running into its bottom Bollinger Band and reiterated the bullish rising wedge chart pattern. Additionally, it looks like EUR/CAD is on pace to print a bullish engulfing candlestick, which, if confirmed, provides another indication that the Canadian Dollar has started to reverse back lower. $$$$Keep Reading – US Dollar Chart Setups Post-FOMC: DXY Index, EUR/USD, & AUD/USD.$$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

A staggering selloff across global equities over recent weeks, driven initially by expected economic fallout from the coronavirus, has gained pace after the latest destabilizing black-swan event: a crash in crude oil prices.  $$$$According to the Federal Reserve, the probability of a US recession occurring over the next 12-months, as predicted by the Treasury yield curve spread, was clocked at 31% on February 28. Although distressed credit markets caught a breather following an emergency Fed rate cut last week, its first since the global financial crisis and collapse of Lehman Brothers, the 10-year and three-month interest rate spread (3m10s) on US Treasuries took a 20-basis point tumble in response to the latest crude oil price crash. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$The 3m10s US Treasury yield curve spread now stands at a positive 50-bps after another FOMC liquidity bazooka, but this popular recession gauge appears to be headed back toward inversion territory as investors race into long-dated Treasuries. This might follow rising default risk on high-yield US corporate debt, which presents contagion risk to the broader financial system and economy. $$$$Why Does the US Yield Curve Inversion Matter?$$$$In fact, the options-adjusted spread (OAS)above the risk-free rate of return for high-yield corporate debt exploded higher to 7.2 percentage points as of March 13 – prior to Monday’s 10% slide in stocks and 12% spill in oil prices. $$$$With crude now trading around $30.00/bbl, far below the approximate $50.00/bbl break-even price for US shale oil producers, fund outflows have soared from the iShares High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (Ticker symbol: HYG), which has over 10% of its market value exposed to poor credit quality energy companies. $$$$Likewise, countries heavily dependent on oil exports like Canada or Mexico have seen their currencies plummet relative to safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar and Japanese Yen. At the same time, the broader US Dollar Index (Ticker symbol: DXY), which is heavily weighted to EUR/USD performance, cratered to an 18-month low, but the Greenback has since recovered almost all of its recent downside.$$$$Selling pressure in the USD was sparked amid rekindled recession odds following the IHS Markit PMI report for February that detailed a contraction in US business activity, and notably the services sector, to a 76-month low. As such, it seems likely that recession risk has intensified alongside growing coronavirus concerns and adverse effects from a crash in crude oil.  $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.
VIX Spikes to Crisis Levels as Markets Crater to Coronavirus Fears	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/03/12/VIX-Spikes-to-Crisis-Levels-as-JS-Markets-Crater-to-Coronavirus-Fears.html	1584032400	It’s been a brutal day across global risk markets. $$$$Coronavirus continues to spark pandemic fears, and related economic slowdowns have become more-and-more likely as the virus has yet to be contained in a number of major economies. $$$$VIX, often referred to as the ‘fear gauge,’ has spiked to levels not seen since the Global Financial Collapse. 	It’s been another big day of moves across global markets and today appears to be somewhat of a turning point. The S&P 500 is now officially in bear market territory following another limit-down move ahead of the US equity open. The VIX, often referred to as the ‘fear gauge’ around the S&P 500 has rushed up to its second highest level ever, trailing only the run that showed during the Financial Collapse. Bond markets remain in disarray and global governments are still shuffling around in an attempt to find a solution to quell the spread of Coronavirus. $$$$To date, no lasting solutions have yet shown. $$$$Another sizable move has shown in the US Dollar with the currency spiking to go along with this morning’s risk-off moves. As covered by our own Justin McQueen earlier this morning, US Dollar funding is sending a distress signal across global markets, with another strong move showing after this morning’s European Central Bank rate decision. $$$$The US Dollar has gained approximately 1.7% today, adding on to the prior bullish move to total a 3.89% move from this week’s low. $$$$USD on Tradingview.$$$$The VIX index is trading just under the 70-level, which marks the second highest reading ever, rivaling only the Financial Collapse. $$$$VIX on Tradingview.$$$$As looked at earlier this morning, equities have already put in a profound move; rushing into ‘bear market’ territory after the longest bull market in recorded history. My colleague, Austin Sealey, took a wide look at the matter, incorporating some global equity indices. Perhaps more troubling, there’s little evidence to suggest that the sell-offs are yet over. $$$$At this point, the S&P 500 has caught a bit of support around the 2500 psychological level, which is helping to stem the declines, at least for now. $$$$SPX500 on Tradingview.$$$$Back to the FX-world, EUR/USD is putting in an outsized move this morning after the European Central Bank rate decision, furthering the fall from the 1.1448-1.1500 resistance zone looked at earlier this week. $$$$EUR/USD on Tradingview.$$$$Not to be lost in the shuffle and perhaps better illustrating that rush into the US Dollar, USD/CAD has jumped up to a fresh four-year high; covered earlier in the day by my colleague, Michael Boutros. $$$$USD/CAD on Tradingview.$$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.
ECB Could Double Down on TLTROs to Combat Coronavirus Market Meltdown	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/03/12/ECB-Could-Double-Down-on-TLTRO-to-Combat-Coronavirus-Market-Meltdown.html	1584003600	What can the ECB do to combat the impact of COVID-19.$$$$How Central Banks try to induce spending in the economy.$$$$How a looser monetary policy affects interest rates and inflation.$$$$How will investor’s perception of the Euro change if TLTROs are issued again.	The coronavirus crisis has hit economic sentiment hard, starting with an unprecedented sustained sell-off in financial markets followed by an emergency intra-meeting 50 basis points Fed funds and BOE rate cut of . The impact of the virus on the economy is expected to be significant and as yet unquantifiable, leading to a pledge from global Central Banks to provide financial aid. $$$$When looking at the European Central Bank (ECB) their options for additional monetary stimulus are a lot more limited than those of the Fed. Having taken interest rates into negative territory and pumping more than 2.6 trillion euros into the economy in the last 5 years, their hands are pretty tied at a time when investors are demanding more policy support.$$$$Given that cutting interest rates is easier to enact, it will probably be the first line of defence for the ECB in the coming days. But there are doubts about the effectiveness of such stimulus given that rates are already at record lows of -0.5%. This move could even lead to a reversal-rate, when monetary policy is perceived to harm rather than aid the economy, and some believe we are already there.$$$$One way of injecting liquidity into the single-bloc, in an effort to boost growth and price pressures, is via Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs). This new round of cheap financing would keep funds flowing in the economy in hope that the current market meltdown is not exasperated by a sudden shortage in lending.$$$$Central banks have an unconditional predisposition to provide funding to banks that face a liquidity crisis. A method that has previously been used by the ECB to pump money in to the Eurozone economy is Quantitative Easing. QE involves a central bank buying government securities from the market to reduce interest rates and increase the amount of capital in the economy.$$$$As the European Central Bank ended its four-year long QE programme at the end of 2018 with an expectation to increase rates in the following years, a change in the global economic landscape, led by a generalized slowdown in growth, has made the central bank re-think its monetary and fiscal policy strategies. The recent virus outbreak has just added more pressure to an already struggling financial system.$$$$With growth forecasts revised lower at the beginning of 2019, the latest GDP growth forecast left figures unchanged, as the Eurozone economy is now expected to grow 1.2% in 2020, continuing into 2021. But theses figures may have to be revised downward given the material impact the coronavirus is expected to have on worldwide economic development. Inflation, which is needed to control high levels of debt and has a target of 2%, has been revised downward, and is now forecasted to be 1.3% in 2020, compared to a 1.6% forecast in March 2019.$$$$Due to these growth and inflation revisions, the ECB is now looking at the possibility of a new round of TLTRO financing for European banks, with the aim of stimulating the economy and increasing consumer spending.$$$$The generic definition ofTargeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) is the following: they are loan agreements that are aimed at enhancing the function of the monetary policy transmission mechanism by supporting lending to the economy.$$$$Essentially, they are an incentivised long-term loan structure given to banks to increase loan creation. Banks whose lending exceed a specified benchmark will be able to borrow from the ECB at rates between zero and -0.4%. These banks will be expected to keep their net spending above the benchmark, and a breach of this level will mean that they will need to pay back their borrowing in advance.$$$$This means that if banks lend enough, the rate the ECB charges them becomes negative, and as bank loans are the main source of credit in the Eurozone, this will in turn increase private spending in the economy.$$$$Although, TLTROs do not protect banks from insolvency, they aim to stabilize their income stream, as they offer very low interest rates that ensure a stability of loans, that will in turn increase the bank’s liquidity ratio.$$$$The weaker a bank and its subsequent economy are, the more dependant they will become on attractive long-term loans from the ECB. Banks that are borrowing more than they are depositing (mainly banks in Italy, Spain and Greece) are highly dependent on ECB auctions for cash. If monetary stimulus stops, the rate at which banks lend to each other will increase, making borrowing more expensive for the rest of the economy.$$$$The ECB has completed two previous rounds of TLTRO funding; one in June 2014 and a following in June 2016. All these loans are expected to mature by June 2020. A new round of financing would have to come before June this year, as debts with a maturity of under a year are not included in liquidity calculations.$$$$An increase in the money supply, keeping all other factors equal and assuming that the increase in money supply is greater than the growth in real output, will increase prices as there is more money in the economy for the same amount of goods. This will lead to businesses increasing their prices, causing a rise in inflation. If the expansionary monetary policy also includes reducing interest rates, it will add to the inflationary pressure as saving will have a lower return and borrowing will be cheaper, leading to an increase in aggregate demand. $$$$Inflation will cause domestic goods to be more expensive for foreigners which will make them less competitive and will lead to a reduction in exports. This in turn will lower the demand for the local currency and its value will fall in exchange rates. If the supply of the local currency increases, it will put downward pressure on interest rates, making it relatively less attractive to save in the domestic currency, as the rate of return will be better in other currencies. As the domestic currency becomes a less attractive currency there will be a fall in demand which will subsequently lower its exchange rates against other higher-yielding currencies. $$$$An increase in interest rates is a sign of successful expansionary monetary policy. As borrowing becomes cheaper and savings are discouraged, the increase in consumption will increase the velocity of circulation of money in the economy, which will in turn lead to a general increase in the prices. Target inflation has been set at 2%, from which point increase rates should be adjusted upward to control the increase in prices and avoid hyperinflation.$$$$As the supply of euros in the market increases, it will increase the downward pressure on interest rates which have been in negative territory since June 2014, making it harder for the ECB to increase interest rates in the near future. A less attractive euro will decrease its value in exchange rates against higher valued currencies.$$$$Unless the ECB has evidence that inflation has reached its target of 2% and growth in the economy has reached a stable level, it will have to keep interest rates low to induce spending and increase inflation to its desired level, before it can consider increasing rates.$$$$Read more on the impact of interest rates on forex.$$$$Liquidity scarce banks, especially Italian banks, will be the hardest hit if the ECB doesn’t offer a new round of funding as existing bonds come to maturity, and this could mean a hard hit for the Euro.$$$$But as the possibility of a new TLTRO financing round is increasing rapidly, and people are aware that market conditions are not going as planned, markets will be surprised if the ECB does not extend its financing agreements. This would increase bank borrowing costs which will be passed on to consumers which would add more fuel to the current economic slowdown conditions that the Eurozone is facing. This would probably take a toll on the Euro as people have come to terms with the fact that the Eurozone is not as stable and recession free as it was expected.$$$$Graph 1: Impact of cheap lending on EUR/USD $$$$As can be seen on the graph, the Euro took a hit as the central bank first announced that it would increase its “cheap lending” to European banks, which started in 2014. This news was received quite badly by the markets. As the Eurozone seemed to have recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, markets did not expect that the European Central Bank would need to lend funds to banks, that could only mean that the economy was not as strong as people believed and the economy needed stimulating. This was only confirmed by the Greek-government debt crisis and was followed by liquidity struggling banks in countries like Italy and Spain. $$$$Once the Quantitative Easing program and bank financing consolidated, the Euro started to gain a little more strength against other major currencies like the dollar, but it has not managed to recover those 2013 highs. As mentioned above, markets are now accustomed to the fact that the ECB needs to help banks with their funding as they struggle with liquidity, so a new round of financing is mostly seen as a positive rather than negative sign for the Eurozone economy.$$$$To find out more about Central Bank decisions taking place and how they have an effect on the market, sign up to our Central Bank Weekly Seminar with Christopher Vecchio.

EUR/USD Outlook: ECB Must Act Decisively as Recession Looms and Markets Collapse	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/03/12/EURUSD-Outlook-ECB-Must-Act-Decisively-as-Recession-Looms-and-Markets-Collapse.html	1584010800	The ECB must use all tools available to battle the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.$$$$EUR/USD likely to be extremely volatile post-ECB announcement.	As the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc with countries across the globe, a clutch of G7 central banks have already cut interest rates and provided additional liquidity for their economies to try and re-boot output and prompt spending. It is now the turn of the ECB to act, and any sign of wavering or half-hearted attempts to boost the single-blocs economy may well see the Euro come under increased selling pressure.$$$$Live Data Coverage – ECB Rate Decision Webinar.$$$$In late-July 2012, the then President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, told a conference in London that in order to protect the Euro, the central bank would do ‘whatever it takes to preserve the Euro’, adding forcibly ‘And believe me, it will be enough’. This stance, and the quantitative easing program that followed, helped to shore up confidence in the single currency and eventually boost its value in the foreign exchange markets. Now current ECB President Christine Lagarde must follow in Draghi’s steps and the central bank must do whatever it can to protect the Eurozone, albeit with limited resources. Interest rates need to cut further into negative territory, the bond buying program (QE) needs to be increased, country issuer limits need to be raised, the TLTRO program needs to be boosted and additional liquidity needs to be found to help companies struggling against the coronavirus breakout. $$$$Most importantly, President Lagarde must gain the market’s confidence, prove that she is in control and is prepared to do ‘Whatever it Takes’.  $$$$ECB Could Double Down on TLTROs to Combat Coronavirus Market Meltdown.$$$$After spiking to just under 1.1500 on Monday, EUR/USD has seen a sharp correction lower and now trades in the low 1.1225s as sellers take control of the market. The latest weakness in the pair stems from both a stronger US dollar and market expectations that the ECB will act decisively today and loosen monetary conditions further. Initial support is seen around the 1.1185-1.1187 area although this may not hold if the ECB go all in. Volatility is expected to remain at recent extreme high levels and the pair may see choppy trading during the ECB Press Conference from 13:30 GMT onwards. $$$$For all market moving data and events please the DailyFX calendar.$$$$Traders may be interested in two of our trading guides – Traits of Successful Traders and Top Trading Lessons – while technical analysts are likely to be interested in our latest Elliott Wave Guide.$$$$What is your view on EURUSD – bullish or bearish??

Euro Price Outlook: EUR/USD 'V-Shaped' Recovery Nears Completion	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/03/05/Euro-Price-Outlook-EURUSD-V-Shaped-Recovery-Nears-Completion.html	1583410620	EUR/USD rallies 4% since February 20 low.$$$$ECB expected to loosen monetary policy further next week.	The euro has been in demand against a range of currencies in the last three weeks and is closing in on the December 31 high at 1.1239 to complete a ‘V-shaped’ recovery. The low print filled the ‘Macron gap’ between 1.0777 and 1.0821 made on the weekly chart in mid-April 2017 and since then has pushed higher with old resistance zones and all three moving averages providing little in the way of resistance. The move has been helped by a weakening of the US dollar, with Tuesday’s 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed, and expectations of further cuts at the March 17-18 FOMC meeting, providing an additional catalyst.$$$$For all market moving data and events please the DailyFX calendar.$$$$The Euro may soon come under downside pressure with growing expectations that the ECB will further loosen monetary policy at next Thursday’s central bank meeting. While the ECB may cut interest rates by a further 10 basis points, to take the lending rate further negative to -0.60%, this may do little to help boost aggregate demand in the single-block. It is likely that the ECB will increase lending to SMEs to help prompt economic activity and boost growth, putting downside pressure on the Euro. $$$$EUR/USD’s recovery now nears an important area with Tuesday’s 1.1213 spike high standing in the way of 1.1239. The sequence of lower highs that start all the way back from February 2018 have already been broken by the December 31 print and a close above that level would add credibility to a further move higher in the medium-term. The CCI indicator shows that the pair are overbought at the moment which may slow down any further upside momentum.$$$$Traders may be interested in two of our trading guides – Traits of Successful Traders and Top Trading Lessons – while technical analysts are likely to be interested in our latest Elliott Wave Guide.$$$$What is your view on EURUSD – bullish or bearish??

The US dollar continues its recent freefall against a range of G7 currencies with EUR/USD now looking to break above 1.1300 and beyond. This week’s emergency 50 basis point Fed interest rate cut pulled the rug from under the greenback as markets decided that the move was not enough. Markets have now fully priced in a 25bp rate cut at the March 17-18 FOMC meeting and a 50bp cut is nearly fully priced in. US Treasury yields continue to slump with the 10-year now offering just 73 basis points - a record low - while the 30-year UST offers a miserly 1.32%. Bond yields fall as prices rise. $$$$We looked at EUR/USD on Thursday and suggested that a move to the December 31 high around 1.1239 looked imminent and this level has now been breached and convincingly. $$$$Euro Price Outlook: EUR/USD ‘V-shaped’ Recovery Nears Completion.$$$$The recent CoT report showed that EUR short positions had grown over the week, and it is likely the recent spike higher in Euro against the US dollar are these shorts now rushing to cover their positions.  $$$$EUR/USD is now looking for its next upside target with little in the way of resistance ahead of 1.1412. The latest move has also negated the run of lower highs on the chart, another positive for EUR/USD bulls. There is a potential roadblock for higher prices later today with the February US Jobs Report scheduled for release at 13:30 GMT, an event that normally sparks US dollar volatility and movement. Market expectations are for 175k new jobs to have been created in the month, compared to 225k in January, and a number today nearer 200k may stem the US dollar sell-off in the short-term.

ECB Could Double Down on TLTROs to Combat Coronavirus Market Meltdown	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/03/10/ECB-Could-Double-Down-on-TLTRO-to-Combat-Coronavirus-Market-Meltdown.html	1583917200	What can the ECB do to combat the impact of COVID-19.$$$$How Central Banks try to induce spending in the economy.$$$$How a looser monetary policy affects interest rates and inflation.$$$$How will investor’s perception of the Euro change if TLTROs are issued again.	The coronavirus crisis has hit economic sentiment hard, starting with an unprecedented sustained sell-off in financial markets followed by an emergency intra-meeting Fed funds rate cut of 50 basis points. The impact of the virus on the economy is expected to be significant and as yet unquantifiable, leading to a pledge from global Central Banks to provide financial aid. $$$$When looking at the European Central Bank (ECB) their options for additional monetary stimulus are a lot more limited than those of the Fed. Having taken interest rates into negative territory and pumping more than 2.6 trillion euros into the economy in the last 5 years, their hands are pretty tied at a time when investors are demanding more policy support.$$$$Given that cutting interest rates is easier to enact, it will probably be the first line of defence for the ECB in the coming days. But there are doubts about the effectiveness of such stimulus given that rates are already at record lows of -0.5%. This move could even lead to a reversal-rate, when monetary policy is perceived to harm rather than aid the economy, and some believe we are already there.$$$$One way of injecting liquidity into the single-bloc, in an effort to boost growth and price pressures, is via Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs). This new round of cheap financing would keep funds flowing in the economy in hope that the current market meltdown is not exasperated by a sudden shortage in lending.$$$$Central banks have an unconditional predisposition to provide funding to banks that face a liquidity crisis. A method that has previously been used by the ECB to pump money in to the Eurozone economy is Quantitative Easing. QE involves a central bank buying government securities from the market to reduce interest rates and increase the amount of capital in the economy.$$$$As the European Central Bank ended its four-year long QE programme at the end of 2018 with an expectation to increase rates in the following years, a change in the global economic landscape, led by a generalized slowdown in growth, has made the central bank re-think its monetary and fiscal policy strategies. The recent virus outbreak has just added more pressure to an already struggling financial system.$$$$With growth forecasts revised lower at the beginning of 2019, the latest GDP growth forecast left figures unchanged, as the Eurozone economy is now expected to grow 1.2% in 2020, continuing into 2021. But theses figures may have to be revised downward given the material impact the coronavirus is expected to have on worldwide economic development. Inflation, which is needed to control high levels of debt and has a target of 2%, has been revised downward, and is now forecasted to be 1.3% in 2020, compared to a 1.6% forecast in March 2019.$$$$Due to these growth and inflation revisions, the ECB is now looking at the possibility of a new round of TLTRO financing for European banks, with the aim of stimulating the economy and increasing consumer spending.$$$$The generic definition ofTargeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) is the following: they are loan agreements that are aimed at enhancing the function of the monetary policy transmission mechanism by supporting lending to the economy.$$$$Essentially, they are an incentivised long-term loan structure given to banks to increase loan creation. Banks whose lending exceed a specified benchmark will be able to borrow from the ECB at rates between zero and -0.4%. These banks will be expected to keep their net spending above the benchmark, and a breach of this level will mean that they will need to pay back their borrowing in advance.$$$$This means that if banks lend enough, the rate the ECB charges them becomes negative, and as bank loans are the main source of credit in the Eurozone, this will in turn increase private spending in the economy.$$$$Although, TLTROs do not protect banks from insolvency, they aim to stabilize their income stream, as they offer very low interest rates that ensure a stability of loans, that will in turn increase the bank’s liquidity ratio.$$$$The weaker a bank and its subsequent economy are, the more dependant they will become on attractive long-term loans from the ECB. Banks that are borrowing more than they are depositing (mainly banks in Italy, Spain and Greece) are highly dependent on ECB auctions for cash. If monetary stimulus stops, the rate at which banks lend to each other will increase, making borrowing more expensive for the rest of the economy.$$$$The ECB has completed two previous rounds of TLTRO funding; one in June 2014 and a following in June 2016. All these loans are expected to mature by June 2020. A new round of financing would have to come before June this year, as debts with a maturity of under a year are not included in liquidity calculations.$$$$An increase in the money supply, keeping all other factors equal and assuming that the increase in money supply is greater than the growth in real output, will increase prices as there is more money in the economy for the same amount of goods. This will lead to businesses increasing their prices, causing a rise in inflation. If the expansionary monetary policy also includes reducing interest rates, it will add to the inflationary pressure as saving will have a lower return and borrowing will be cheaper, leading to an increase in aggregate demand. $$$$Inflation will cause domestic goods to be more expensive for foreigners which will make them less competitive and will lead to a reduction in exports. This in turn will lower the demand for the local currency and its value will fall in exchange rates. If the supply of the local currency increases, it will put downward pressure on interest rates, making it relatively less attractive to save in the domestic currency, as the rate of return will be better in other currencies. As the domestic currency becomes a less attractive currency there will be a fall in demand which will subsequently lower its exchange rates against other higher-yielding currencies. $$$$An increase in interest rates is a sign of successful expansionary monetary policy. As borrowing becomes cheaper and savings are discouraged, the increase in consumption will increase the velocity of circulation of money in the economy, which will in turn lead to a general increase in the prices. Target inflation has been set at 2%, from which point increase rates should be adjusted upward to control the increase in prices and avoid hyperinflation.$$$$As the supply of euros in the market increases, it will increase the downward pressure on interest rates which have been in negative territory since June 2014, making it harder for the ECB to increase interest rates in the near future. A less attractive euro will decrease its value in exchange rates against higher valued currencies.$$$$Unless the ECB has evidence that inflation has reached its target of 2% and growth in the economy has reached a stable level, it will have to keep interest rates low to induce spending and increase inflation to its desired level, before it can consider increasing rates.$$$$Read more on the impact of interest rates on forex.$$$$Liquidity scarce banks, especially Italian banks, will be the hardest hit if the ECB doesn’t offer a new round of funding as existing bonds come to maturity, and this could mean a hard hit for the Euro.$$$$But as the possibility of a new TLTRO financing round is increasing rapidly, and people are aware that market conditions are not going as planned, markets will be surprised if the ECB does not extend its financing agreements. This would increase bank borrowing costs which will be passed on to consumers which would add more fuel to the current economic slowdown conditions that the Eurozone is facing. This would probably take a toll on the Euro as people have come to terms with the fact that the Eurozone is not as stable and recession free as it was expected.$$$$Graph 1: Impact of cheap lending on EUR/USD $$$$As can be seen on the graph, the Euro took a hit as the central bank first announced that it would increase its “cheap lending” to European banks, which started in 2014. This news was received quite badly by the markets. As the Eurozone seemed to have recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, markets did not expect that the European Central Bank would need to lend funds to banks, that could only mean that the economy was not as strong as people believed and the economy needed stimulating. This was only confirmed by the Greek-government debt crisis and was followed by liquidity struggling banks in countries like Italy and Spain. $$$$Once the Quantitative Easing program and bank financing consolidated, the Euro started to gain a little more strength against other major currencies like the dollar, but it has not managed to recover those 2013 highs. As mentioned above, markets are now accustomed to the fact that the ECB needs to help banks with their funding as they struggle with liquidity, so a new round of financing is mostly seen as a positive rather than negative sign for the Eurozone economy.$$$$To find out more about Central Bank decisions taking place and how they have an effect on the market, sign up to our Central Bank Weekly Seminar with Christopher Vecchio.

The most actively traded currency pair in the market, EUR/USD, continues to slip lower after yesterday’s ECB meeting failed to boost confidence in the single-market’s currency. Thursday’s wild swings saw the pair trade in a near three-big figure range, and current quotes show the pair four-big figures lower from Monday’s 1.1496 high print. Thursday’s daily candle will now likely restrict price action in the near-future.$$$$The Euro is getting mild support from higher Eurozone bond yields after ECB President Christine Lagarde’s comments yesterday that the central bank was ’not here to close spreads’ in the sovereign debt space. This comment caused Italian bond yields, already under pressure due to the coronavirus epidemic, to jump sharply higher, causing the spread between Italian and German bonds to widen sharply. The additional EUR120 billion of QE announced for 2020 may temper these moves in the future, but for now the Euro remains under pressure.$$$$Chart via Investing.com.$$$$This week’s price moves have pushed volatility levels in the pair back to highs seen in early February 2019, using the ATR indicator. We noted recently that the longer-term series of lower highs had been broken and this may add a level of support to the pair, but this week’s bearish momentum continues to drive price action. Support may kick-in either side of 1.1100, while the 200-day moving average - the black line on the chart – acted as support yesterday.

The ECB is going to have to come up with another round of monetary easing to help build confidence in the single-currency and quickly as the coronavirus shuts down swathes of member states. ECB President Lagarde’s recent policy announcement was seen at the time as too little and now the central bank must come back with more to help the single-block. There has been talk, not verified, that some member stated are looking at fiscal measures to shore up their economies. While the ECB stay quiet, the single currency is likely to weaken further.$$$$The US on the other hand are now going all-in, introducing further massive liquidity measures and opening swap lines, and suggesting a $1,000 money drop to most of the population, to try and keep the economy from falling to far into negative territory. The US dollar basket (DXY) is now trading at highs last seen in April 2017. Global central banks are acting increasingly quickly, leaving traders at risk, as volatility spikes ever higher.$$$$EUR/USD is attempting another break lower, back below 1.0950, which would leave 1.0777 as the near-term target. The CCI indicator is not yet in oversold territory, while volatility has ramped up to levels last seen over a year ago, leaving further room to fall.

The price rallied after and settled above 1.1100 handle, then closed the weekly candlestick in the red with 1.6% loss. $$$$That said, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained above 50 indicating that uptrend move was still intact. $$$$Looking at the daily chart, we noticed that at the start of last week, EUR/USD opened with a runaway gap to the upside highlighting unfinished uptrend move. On Wednesday, the market declined to current trading zone 1.1087 – 1.1300. Later on, the price have failed twice to fall further, signaling a possible bull’s comeback. $$$$Hence, a close above the high end of the zone could push EURUSD towards 1.1640. Further close above that level may send the pair even higher towards 1.1876. In that scenario, special attention should be paid to the daily and weekly resistance levels underlined on the chart (zoomed in) as some traders may exit/join the market around these points. $$$$In turn, any close below the low end reflects bull’s reluctance. This might lead some of them to exit the market allowing the price tow fall eyeing a test of 1.0912. Further close below this level could mean more bearishness towards1.0825. Nevertheless, the weekly support levels printed on the chart should be considered. $$$$From the four-hour chart, we noticed that on Monday uptrend move led EUR/USD to 1.1496 – its highest level in over thirteen months. In the following days, the price reversed its move creating lower highs with lower lows. $$$$Thus, a break below 1.1050 could lead EURUSD towards 1.0959. Yet, the weekly support level underscored on the chart should be kept in focus. On the other hand, any break above 1.1371 might cause a rally towards 1.1553. Although, the daily resistance level printed on the chart should be watched closely. $$$$See the chart to know more about key technical levels in a further bullish/bearish scenario.  $$$$Written By: Mahmoud Alkudsi.$$$$Please feel free to contact me on Twitter: @Malkudsi.
EUR/USD Plunges to Multi-Year Lows, German GDP Predicted to Slump in Q2	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/03/19/EURUSD-Plunges-to-Multi-Year-Lows-German-GDP-Predicted-to-Slump-in-Q2.html	1584624600	EUR/USD slumps to 1.0750 after ECB announces EUR750bn of Pandemic-QE.$$$$IFO predicts German Q2 GDP to slump to -4.5%.	We wrote yesterday that the ECB needed to respond the economic threat posed by the coronavirus immediately, and later in the day the central bank did just that, announcing a fresh EUR750bn pandemic QE program to run through until at least the end of 2020. The ECB also left open the door for further monetary action if needed:$$$$“The Governing Council will do everything necessary within its mandate. The Governing Council is fully prepared to increase the size of its asset purchase programmes and adjust their composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. It will explore all options and all contingencies to support the economy through this shock.”$$$$Euro Struggles to Hold 1.1000 Against a Rampant US Dollar.$$$$Further action may be required if the latest predictions by the German IFO materialize. While global second-quarter GDP figures are expected to show recessionary forces building, IFO’s estimation of Q2 German GDP at minus 4.5% is aheadline-grabbing prediction and one that policy makers need to heed. German unemployment is also expected to rise from 5.0% in 2019 to 5.3% in 2020.$$$$IFO Economic Forecast Spring 2020 – The Economy Slumps.$$$$The US dollar (DXY) continues to rise to fresh highs and a break above 103.85 will see the greenback at highs last seen in 2003. The US dollar is the dominant safe-haven of choice and is likely to remain so in the short-term. $$$$Against these forces, EUR/USD has finally broken lower, opening the way for further losses. The 1.0777 level was tested on February 20 this year and prompted a sharp bounce back to 1.1495 in less than three weeks. The break below 1.077 needs to be confirmed by a close below this level and will likely see the pair test older support levels between 1.0340 and 1.0569, made in the first two months of 2017. Traders should remain on notice that the current unprecedented market conditions will be met by unprecedented central bank action. Volatility levels will remain at current multi-months and price action will be wild and fast as central bankers battle the spread of coronavirus.$$$$For all market moving data and events please the DailyFX calendar.$$$$Traders may be interested in two of our trading guides – Traits of Successful Traders and Top Trading Lessons – while technical analysts are likely to be interested in our latest Elliott Wave Guide.$$$$What is your view on EURUSD – bullish or bearish??

US Dollar Surges on Funding Market Distress Signal: Risk of Explosive Breakout	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/03/17/US-Dollar-Surges-on-Funding-Market-Distress-Signal-Risk-of-Explosive-Breakout.html	1584447900	US Dollar Surge Amid Distressed Funding Market.$$$$US Dollar to Break 100?$$$$2008 Recession Saw Greenback Surge 15% 	Last week we highlighted that distress signals were beginning to grow louder as cross currency basis swaps were beginning to widen (Xccy Basis Swap), which in turn emphasises concerns over a dollar shortage. Consequently, this had prompted the Federal Reserve to announce a $1.5tln liquidity boost via repo operations before announcing another rate cut in the target range to 0-0.25%, alongside a restart in the QE program and USD swap lines. However, despite this, the US Dollar has taken the aggressive easing package within its stride and continued to strengthen as Xccy basis swaps have widened further, raising the cost of dollar shorts as supply dries up (Figure 1).$$$$Source: Refinitiv. $$$$Example: If a European company takes out a 3-month loan from its local bank to pay for its US business overseas. In order for the company to hedge the currency risk, the company would enter into a 3-month EUR/USD currency swap with a counterparty. A certain number of Euros to US Dollars would be swapped at the current rate while also agreeing to swap the funds back in 3-months’ time. Given that the European company is borrowing dollars they would have to pay out US libor interest and receive Euribor interest (reminder Euribor is negative and therefore would have to pay out Euribor). $$$$If 3-month US libor was 0.85% and Euribor is -0.45%, the cost of the swap to the European company is 1.3%. With concerns of a dollar shortage, the counterparty quotes a basis of -110bps, meaning that the cost of the swap to the European company would increase to 2.4%.$$$$A continued widening in basis swaps would likely lead the US Dollar to extend on its recent gains. Of note, according to BIS data, total bank loans and debt securities issues, by residence of non-bank borrower highlights that US Dollars funding is at over $12tln, with Euro and Japanese Yen funding at $3.5tln and $440bln respectively. As a reminder, the US Dollar soared over 15% as cross currency basis swaps saw explosive widening.$$$$--- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst.$$$$Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX.

USD/MXN Price Volatility Continues as Pair Probes Topside Barrier	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/04/01/USDMXN-Price-Volatility-Continues-as-Pair-Probes-Topside-Barrier.html	1585780500	The Mexican Peso suffered in the month of March alongside other emerging market currencies.$$$$As safe haven demand drove the US Dollar higher, a remarkable decline in crude oil undermined the Mexican Peso simultaneously.$$$$With the recent rebound slowing down, USD/MXN may continue higher with persistent volatility.	The Mexican Peso suffered another decline versus the US Dollar on Wednesday, falling more than 2.75%. While other volatility metrics have receded, USD/MXN has been somewhat of an outlier as the pair continues to post significant daily moves. While some degree of volatility is to be expected - relative to EUR/USD for instance - it can be attractive for traders in search of raw price action. $$$$Chart created in TradingView. Average True Range in crimson.$$$$To that end, the pair’s 10-day average true range reveals the degree to which USD/MXN has fluctuated in recent weeks. Since the outlook for the global economy is declining almost daily, emerging market currencies and those with heightened exposure to growth-sensitive commodities like crude oil may continue to slip. With that in mind, USD/MXN is in a strong position to continue higher in the weeks ahead barring a significant shift in sentiment. $$$$Therefore, USD/MXN may make another attempt at the 24.6417 level – an area that has resisted recent attempts higher. Resistance above 24.6417 should reside at the swing-high posted on March 24 around 25.4587. A break above the peak would suggest bulls are willing to continue higher and could, as a result, see prior resistance turn to support. $$$$Renewed risk appetite would favor USD/MXN and may allow the pair to probe support beneath around the Fibonacci level at 23.3739. Should it fail, subsequent assistance may be offered from an ascending trendline drawn off various swing-lows in March. Either way, the technical levels outlined will look to provide influence over price in the days ahead and heightened volatility may see rapid price developments ripe with trading opportunities. $$$$--Written by Peter Hanks, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow Peter on Twitter @PeterHanksFX.
EUR/USD Price: Rally at Risk after Shocking Eurozone PMI Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/03/24/EURUSD-Price-Rally-at-Risk-after-Shocking-Eurozone-PMI-Data.html	1585041420	EUR/USD rally hits a stumbling block.$$$$Eurozone PMIs highlight huge economic contraction taking hold.	A shocking set of preliminary Eurozone PMI data for March shows the economy in the single-block free-falling into recession, leaving the Euro exposed against a range of other currencies. The latest PMI readings suggest that Eurozone quarterly GDP is slumping by around 2%, with the likelihood of a further severe downturn.$$$$Commenting on the Eurozone flash PMI data for March, Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said: “Business activity across the eurozone collapsed in March to an extent far exceeding that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis…the March PMI is indicative of GDP slumping at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and clearly there’s scope for the downturn to intensify further as even more draconian policies to deal with the virus are potentially implemented in coming months.”$$$$Commenting on the German flash PMI data for March, Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit said: “The unprecedented collapse in the PMI underscores how Germany is headed for recession, and a steep one at that. The March data are indicative of GDP falling at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus outbreak mean we should be braced for the downturn to further intensify in the second quarter.”$$$$Commenting on the French flash PMI data for March, Eliot Kerr, Economist at IHS Markit said: “The latest PMI data revealed dismal results for the French private sector, with coronavirus-driven shutdowns leading to widespread economic disruption. “March saw a record rate of declines for services activity, while the manufacturing sector suffered to the greatest extent since the global financial crisis. Taken together, these declines suggest GDP is collapsing at an annualised rate approaching double digits.$$$$Weekly Euro Forecast – EUR/USD Outlook Remains Bearish.$$$$EUR/USD recent pick-up has been driven primarily in the recent sell-off of the US dollar after the Federal Reserve announced unlimited QE in order to stem the economic havoc being fueled by the coronavirus.

US Dollar Index, EUR/USD Charts & More	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/03/31/US-Dollar-Index-EURUSD-Charts-More-PRtech.html	1585657800	US Dollar Index volatility to give-way to a trend.$$$$EUR/USD could test a multi-decade trend-line soon.	The US Dollar index has been swinging around rather violently since the coronavirus gripped financial markets. Unlike stocks, bonds, and economically sensitive commodities there hasn’t been a clear sustainable trend. The sharp decline, rally, then sharp decline again since late February has forced traders to make fast trading decisions. That is anticipated to give-way to a sustainable trend, but which way will that be? The broader trend has been upward, and the most powerful portion of those swings was to the upside. Risk is thus skewed at this time towards seeing stabilization that results in a move higher. This may take a little time to work itself out, but soon one way or the other we should have something more concrete to work with.$$$$US Dollar Index Chart by TradingView.$$$$EUR/USD is about 57% of the USD index, and as such it is the primary driver. It won’t take much more of a downturn to put the Euro back on a trend-line that extends higher from the early 1980s, if you take into consideration the currencies that were folded into the single-currency. Below you can see it back to 2000, which even on its own makes it an impressive long-term threshold. It was briefly breached during the recent sell-off, but held on a monthly basis. It’s support until it breaks, but if it does it could send EUR/USD much lower, and conversely the DXY much higher.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$For all the charts we looked at, check out the video above…$$$$Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, DailyFX has several resources available to help you; indicator for tracking trader sentiment, quarterly trading forecasts, analytical and educational webinars held daily, and trading guides to help you improve trading performance. $$$$We also have a series of guides for those looking to trade specific markets, such as the S&P 500, Dow, DAX, gold, silver, crude oil, and copper.$$$$---Written by Paul Robinson, Market Analyst.$$$$You can follow Paul on Twitter at @PaulRobinsonFX.

Inflation in the Eurozone is slipping lower with the provisional core CPI reading for March released at 1.0%, below expectations of 1.1% and a prior month’s 1.2%. While inflation may not be on the top of the ECB’s ‘to fix’ list, when the coronavirus situation steadies and is eventually cured, the central bank will need to look at how to resolve the underlying weakness in inflation. $$$$Earlier in the session, German unemployment change (March) came in better than expected – 1k vs. 25k – although the figures only cover up to March 12 and do not show the full effect of the coronavirus shutdown.$$$$The daily EUR/USD is now starting to look weaker with the pair over 150 pips off Monday’s high print at 1.1145. EUR/USD is currently trading below all three moving averages, and opened below the 200-dma, casting a negative shadow on the pair. A short-term Fibonacci set-up on the March 9 to March 22 sharp sell-off shows the important 38.2% retracement level very close at 1.09645. If this breached and closed below then further losses may be seen with a zone between 1.0875 and1.0895 the first level of support.

US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/02/25/US-Dollar-Price-Action-Setups-USD-EUR-USD-USD-CAD-GBP-USD-USD-JPY-JS.html	1582660800	Noticeable reversals have developed in a number of markets. $$$$EUR/USD is pushing higher from a bullish short-term formation. $$$$GBP/USD, USD/CAD and USD/JPY may all have bullish USD-backdrops to work with for those looking to fade this recent Dollar-weakness. 	US equities have continued their descent as a potent cocktail of risk has come into the equation. And while the Coronavirus fears seem an obvious driver, another scenario has popped up of recent that may be assisting with the sell-off, and that’s the prospect of a Bernie Sanders nomination ahead of this year’s US Presidential election. From a deductive perspective, it would be difficult to rule it out given the performance at last week’s debates; and tonight brings another debate which will provide ample opportunity to test that theory. $$$$Prices in the S&P 500 have pushed down to a fresh 2020 low and sellers remain in-control of short-term price action. $$$$SPX500 on Tradingview.$$$$One of the big items from today is a fresh all-time-low in the US Treasury 10-year-note; falling below any crisis levels from the Financial Collapse. A far cry from the 3.25% in October of 2018 or the 2.7% from just a year ago in February of 2019. $$$$US Ten Year Note Yield: Fresh All-Time-Lows.$$$$TNX on Tradingview.$$$$This follows yesterday’s observation of the same thing taking place in the 30-year Treasury bond, pushing down to a fresh all-time-low, ticking inside of 1.8%. $$$$TYX on Tradingview.$$$$Going along with that risk aversion theme over the past few trading days has been a reversal in USD. It was just a week ago that the Greenback made a strong topside run towards the 100.00 figure in DXY. But that faltered and since then bears have come back into the picture. $$$$USD on Tradingview.$$$$I had written about this one earlier this morning as EUR/USD was beginning to show tendencies of reversal. The pair had put in an ascending triangle formation on a short-term basis, very similar to what had shown in the USD in early-January. EUR/USD has since broken out, and forward resistance exists at 1.0890 and 1.0925; after which the big zone of prior support comes into play around the 1.1000 psychological level. $$$$EUR/USD on Tradingview.$$$$On the long side of the US Dollar, USD/CAD remains of interest. I had looked into this setup last week and again this morning; as the January-February bullish run ran into a key level of resistance. After that, an orderly pullback showed in the form of a falling wedge, which takes on the tone or temper of a bull flag formation. $$$$This, especially given the recent rash of USD-weakness, highlights just how weak the Canadian Dollar has been. This also keeps the door open for bullish potential in the pair should USD-strength return. $$$$USD/CAD on Tradingview.$$$$GBP/USD is testing potential resistance at a key area on the chart, running from 1.3000-1.3013. $$$$GBP/USD on Tradingview.$$$$Last week’s massive breakout in USD/JPY has been mostly unwound at this point. Price action is now testing a key area of potential support, taken from a prior resistance zone that’s confluent with the 110.00 psychological level. $$$$USD/JPY on Tradingview.$$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.
EUR/USD Price Slumps Through Support Ahead of US Jobs Data, Chart Remains Weak	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/02/07/EURUSD-Price-Slumps-Through-Support-Ahead-of-US-Jobs-Data-Chart-Remains-Weak.html	1581070800	German industrial production data highlights economic weakness.$$$$EURUSD takes out support and eyes multi-month lows.

While the short-to medium-term trend looks set in EUR/USD, the oversold nature of the market, using CCI, may support the pair for now.

Recently released German factory orders data showed further evidence that growth in the euro-zone’s largest economy remains anemic and unlikely to change in the short-term. German order books fell to their lowest level in over a decade, with exports from the automobile sector falling by 13% last year.  $$$$Today’s data follows on from yesterday’s euro-zone retail sales release that showed spending falling in December.

The US dollar basket (DXY) touched a fresh two-month high today, continuing the strong rally seen since the start of the year, after recent robust US data, including the recent private payrolls report (ADP) that showed 291,000 new jobs created in January, the largest gain in four years. While the correlation between the ADP figures and the NFP jobs report, out tomorrow, is not a given, there is a real chance that Friday’s figures could be a lot higher than current market expectations of 160k.$$$$Live Data Coverage of US NFPs from 13:15 GMT on February 7 with DFX analyst Richard Dvorak.$$$$The daily EUR/USD chart shows the pair closing in on a support zone between 1.0981 and 1.0989 that has held since early-October 2019.

EUR/USD Latest: Eurozone Economy Slows as Inflation Weakens Even Further	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/01/31/EURUSD-Latest-Eurozone-Economy-Slows-as-Inflation-Weakens-Even-Further.html	1580466600	Eurozone GDP falls to 0.1% in Q4 2019.$$$$Inflation continues to fall despite monetary support from the ECB.$$$$EUR/USD continues to show signs of weakness 	After a week dominated by the fears of a mass spread of the coronavirus outbreak, EURUSD continued to trade lower into Friday morning as traders anticipated the latest release of Eurozone GDP and inflation data.$$$$And downward pressure continued as a preliminary reading showed that Eurozone GDP shrank to 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019, down from 0.2% in the previous quarter and below market expectations of an unchanged reading. Year on year growth also softened to 1%, down from 1.2% from the previous reading and below expectations of 1.1%. $$$$The Eurozone figure comes after a 0.1% contraction in French Q4 GDP, and a better than expected 0.5% Q4 growth in Spain. Recent data coming from the Eurozone has been mixed, where an uptick in PMI data has been offset by a fall in industrial production and worsening employment data. This has kept the common currency subdued in recent weeks, overpowered by the increase in demand for the US dollar. $$$$To add to euro weakness, core inflation for the month of January came in at 1.1%, down from 1.3% in the previous month, whilst headline inflation picked up to 1.4% from 1.3% in the previous month. Both figures remain well below the desired level of 2% set by the ECB, which announced in their last monetary policy meeting they would be reviewing whether the current strategy is appropriate, given the consistent weakness in CPI readings. $$$$The recent downward pressure on the Euro has caused the pair to depreciate 1.85% in the month of January, below a key support level at 1.1100. But a small reversal on Thursday’s session has broken the downward channel that has been in play since Thursday the 16th, which was supported by an uptick in the RSI. Short-term resistance is now found at the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement from the highs of December 2019, at 1.1042, in confluence with the 200-SMA on the 1-hour chart. The price is supported on the downside by both the 50- and 100-SMA at 1.1017.$$$$A fall below that level can see EUR/USD revisiting the 100% Fibonacci retracement at 1.0981, which has served as a key support/resistance level throughout the last quarter of 2019. On the upside, support-turned-resistance at 1.1100 and 1.1125 remain as key targets for an upward reversal.$$$$--- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst.$$$$Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin.

EUR/USD bouncing off support around 11000 is starting to prove to be short-lived as it turns down off resistance via the trend-line from off the December high and the underside of the trend-line rising up from October. A break below 11000 could have the low from the fall under fire as new cycle lows appear to be in the works.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$EUR/JPY appears to be in a corrective-move off the recent low. A bear-flag could be in the pipeline, and with the cross-rate below the September trend-line, the broader downtrend looks ready to reassert itself. The 200-day may put a lid on the corrective up-move, while a breakdown below 11977 should have EUR/JPY rolling downhill again. $$$$EUR/JPY Chart by TradingView.$$$$GBP/USDcontinues to find buyers around the 13000/12940-area. It appears though that this area of support is becoming increasingly weakened by the repeated attempts to break it. Should we see Cable get some separation soon, look for it to sell off towards the 200-day under 12700. $$$$GBP/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$GBP/JPY is finding good support around 14100/4080, which is keeping it buoyed for now. However, a descending wedge is coming into view and could spell trouble soon.

"January data pointed to UK business activity, new work and employment all expanding at a faster pace seen that at the end of 2019, according to IHS Markit, as final UK PMI data beat earlier expectations. UK services data hit 53.9, beating the preliminary reading of 52.4 and up sharply from 50.0 seen in December. According to Duncan Brock, group director at CIPS, ""All in all a positive start last month, and if political stability is maintained throughout the year with political promises becoming reality, then 2020 could become a stellar year for service companies.""$$$$Sterling (GBP) reacted positively to the data and pushed back into the mid-1.3000s against the US dollar after hitting a low of 1.2940 on Tuesday. The pair are now touching the 20-day moving average and near the next resistance zone either side of 1.3100. GBP/USD remains stuck in a range with strong resistance at 1.3212 and strong support around 1.2940-1.2950. To breakout from this range, Sterling will need a major fundamental driver with UK-EU trade talks the likely source.$$$$The final release of the Euro-Zone PMIs for January ticked higher and beat the preliminary readings with the composite number rising to its highest level since August, easing fears of a recession in the single block. Business confidence also improved and is now running at a 16-month high, according to data provider IHS Markit. EUR/USD moved higher before slipping back towards 1.10250.

US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/02/11/US-Dollar-Price-Action-Setups-EUR-USD-GBP-USD-USD-JPY-USD-CAD.html	1581451200	Today marked the start of the Fed’s twice-annual Humphrey Hawkins testimony. $$$$A number of additional drivers remain on the calendar for this week, including tomorrow’s release of US CPI for the month of January. $$$$US Dollar strength has run very loudly so far through February, with the currency finally finding some element of resistance earlier today. 	The US Dollar’s bullish trend finally ran into some element of resistance today just ahead of Chair Powell’s Humphrey Hawkins testimony on Capitol Hill. The Greenback has had a strong outing so far in February, gaining each trading day of the month until this morning’s pullback came into play. Prices found a high off of the 78.6% retracement of the Q4 sell-off, and since then a bit of a pullback has started to show. $$$$For longer-term approaches, this can be attractive for bearish swing scenarios. On a shorter-term basis, recent momentum can remain attractive on the long side, looking for this recent pullback to be a corrective part of a bullish item of continuation. $$$$USD on Tradingview.$$$$At the core of that USD-strength has been a sell-off in the Euro, with EUR/USD continuing last week’s breakout below the 1.1000 handle in a fairly consistent manner. Price action pushed all the way below the 1.0900 handle, albeit briefly, before a pullback started to show. This can keep the door open for lower-high resistance potential around the same 1.0955 level that was previously looked at for support. Of note, that prior area of well-heeled support has yet to be tested for resistance around the 1.1000 level. $$$$EUR/USD on Tradingview.$$$$Similar to EUR/USD above, US Dollar strength has been showing very visibly; albeit to a more exaggerated degree against the British Pound. GBP/USD price action ran into a confluent area of support yesterday which has helped to hold the lows. As looked at short-term, prices are making a push-higher, and that prior zone of support around the 1.3000-handle may soon come back into play, opening the door for lower-high scenarios. $$$$GBP/USD on Tradingview.$$$$USD/CAD has put in a notable reversal so far in 2020 after opening the year below the vaulted psychological level of 1.3000. A flip at the BoC in January helped matters, and price action in the pair is now trading near some significant swing highs from the second-half of last year. Follow-through support has shown up at a prior bearish trend-line projection, keeping the door open to long-USD strategies in the pair. $$$$USD/CAD on Tradingview.$$$$Notable is how USD/JPY hasn’t really reflected much of that recent USD-strength, with a number of resistance levels sitting just above. The potential for continued risk aversion around the building fear around coronavirus is likely playing a role, and should risk aversion make another appearance, the short-side of USD/JPY can remain as attractive. I had looked into the backdrop around the pair last week with similar motive; and again this morning as that resistance zone remained in-effect. $$$$USD/JPY on Tradingview.$$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.

EUR/USD dropped six consecutive days as of yesterday, and that in of itself isn’t a reason to neutralize a bearish outlook.

It’s been an extended slide and the pattern has been for any extended move, up or down, to be unsustainable for any lengthy periods of time. With that in mind, traders who are currently short may want to button up trailing stops, those looking for a short, risk/reward isn’t particularly appealing here, and for those looking to take a counter-trend long, the time may be nearing with the right reaction.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$EUR/JPY is fell below a recent area of support after a fake-out blast higher on February 4th. With the longer-term trend lower and the recent break of the September trend-line, the general outlook favors lower prices. There might be a bounce in here or around the 11924 level, but overall without a sustained turnaround the general trading bias remains bearish.$$$$AUD/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$AUD/USD is bouncing off the very bottom of support extending over from the late summer, early fall, right around the 6670 level, but it doesn’t look very sustainable. The anticipation is that the past day-and-a-half bounce will soon fail, taking Aussie below support.

EUR/USD has been getting crushed, with it posting some of its cleanest momentum in some time. The downdraft is so much powerful as persistent. FX volatility remains very low, so the move lower has been relatively orderly.$$$$With that said, things could get volatile soon with some big long-term levels coming up. The French election gap from 2017 is being tested, with a full fill nearing at 10724. There also lies in the vicinity, depending on how you draw it and whether you use a log scale or not, a trend-line running up from 2000. We have to give some latitude given the duration, but it is hanging out in the vicinity. A big reaction could come soon.$$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$USD/JPY has been stuck in a tight range for over a week, highlighting the historically low levels of FX volatility we are seeing these days. There is a solid trend-line from 2015 helping keep a lid on a further advance off the end of January low.

Euro Hangs On After Tough Week As German 4Q GDP Growth Stalls	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/02/14/Euro-German-Fourth-Quarter-Gross-Domestic-Product.html	1581663600	German growth came in weak, as expected.$$$$The quarterly gain was a little better, the annualized a little worse.$$$$EUR/USD has already been hit this week and wasn’t punished further.	The Euro didn’t react much at all Friday to news that German economic growth stagnated into the end of 2019 as that had been very much the markets’ expectation before the fact.$$$$Preliminary Official Gross Domestic Product numbers for the year’s final quarter were flat compared to the previous three months for an annualized gain of just 0.3%, non-seasonally-adjusted. The quarterly rise was a tick lower than the economists had expected, the annualized gain a tick higher. $$$$That 0.3% rise is the weakest seen since the second quarter of 2019, which it matches, but that simply makes it the joint-feeblest print since 2013.$$$$The eurozone has been wrestling with weaker economic numbers for some time, notably from its German engine room. The Euro has already been hit this week by the general withdrawal from riskier, growth-correlated assets which accompanied the latest surge in Chinese coronavirus cases and the bears didn’t feel the need to take another bit out of it on the growth numbers.$$$$The Euro is far from the only asset whose followers will be keeping a close eye on the coronavirus story, but eurozone bulls had been hopeful that the old year might have been the low water mark for growth, which might then go on to pick up thanks to loose monetary policy. $$$$The extent to which the virus’ economic impact may threaten that thesis will be a major trading factor in the weeks and months to come.$$$$The single currency was already down to lows not seen since the first half of 2017 against the US Dollar. The Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc and the greenback have fulfilled their customary haven roles at the euro’s expense for much of this year. $$$$However, the EUR/USD weakness seen so far in 2020 is merely an acceleration of the trend seen since early 2018. Widespread political turmoil, Brexit, global trade troubles and lacklustre economic performance in the eurozone have taken a heavy toll on the currency’s allure. $$$$The downtrend looks extremely well entrenched and likely to continue its dominance, even if coronavirus turns out to be less of an economic drag than the gloomiest prognoses suggest.$$$$Whether you’re new to trading or an old hand DailyFX has plenty of resources to help you.

The latest ZEW data points to increased economic uncertainty in Germany, citing the coronavirus and the negative impact it is having on export expectations. The data fell sharply, missing expectations with ease, and confirm that January’s sharp pick-up was an aberration.$$$$“The feared negative effects of the Coronavirus epidemic in China on world trade have been causing a considerable decline of the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany. Expectations regarding the development of the export-intensive sectors of the economy have dropped particularly sharply. Besides, the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 saw a worse-than-expected development of the German economy. Both the downward revision of the assessment of the economic situation and the downturn in expectations show clearly that economic development is rather fragile at the moment,” said ZEW President Professor Achim Wambach.$$$$For all market moving data and events please the DailyFX calendar.$$$$EUR/USD continues to slide lower and has traded at its lowest level since April 2017 with little in the way of strong support around current levels. On the weekly chart there is a gap between 1.0777 and 1.0821 – made in mid-to-late April 2017 – that looks likely to be filled. Below here, a higher low at 1.05699 guards a double-bottom just under 1.0500. If the bearish sentiment continues, these support levels may come threat, although the move is likely to be made over the medium-term.

Euro Price Analysis: EUR/USD May be Oversold in The Short-Term	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/02/20/Euro-Price-Outlook-EURUSD-May-be-Oversold-in-The-Short-Term.html	1582194600	Technical target achieved – Where next for EUR/USD?$$$$German and Euro-Zone PMI data on Friday will direct the next move in the pair.	The latest decline in EUR/USD saw the pair hit a fresh multi-year low and fill a technical gap on the chart. The gap on the weekly chart between the top of the high of the April 17 candle (1.0777) and the low of the April 24 candle (1.0820) was made when Emmanuel Macron won the first round of the French Presidential election and has long been a target for EUR/USD bears. While this may give the Euro a short-term reprieve against the resurgent US dollar, Friday’s Euro-Zone and German PMI data may see the pair come renewed downside pressure. Euro-Zone and German data released post-January PMIshas turned sharply lower and tomorrow’s PMIs may struggle to match market expectations, putting further downside pressure on the pair.$$$$For all market moving data and events please the DailyFX calendar.$$$$EUR/USD currently trades either side of 1.0800 and has lost nearly 450 pips since the December 31 high at 1.1240. The sell-off accelerated in February and the weekly chart shows the pair now are heavily oversold, using the CCI indicator. While this may trim further losses, the likelihood of further weak data from the single-block will continue to weaken the Euro. The only respite for the pair will come from the US dollar. The value of the greenback continues to soar and currently trades at a nine-month high. This USD-strength will annoy President Trump who continues to argue for a weaker US dollar. Ongoing trade discussions with China and the EU are likely to become more fraught as POTUS believes both are allowing their currencies to slide lower to help boost their export-orientated economies at the expense of the US.    $$$$Traders may be interested in two of our trading guides – Traits of Successful Traders and Top Trading Lessons – while technical analysts are likely to be interested in our latest Elliott Wave Guide.$$$$What is your view on EURUSD – bullish or bearish??

US Dollar Price Action Setups: EUR/USD, USD/CAD, USD/JPY	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/02/20/US-Dollar-Price-Action-Setups-EURUSD-USDCAD-USDJPY-JS.html	1582228800	It’s been a busy past 48 hours across global markets. $$$$A quick rush of Yen-weakness has grabbed attention in FX markets. $$$$Is there a bigger risk off move lurking? 	Continuing our theme from Tuesday, a number of peculiarities have continued to show across global markets; and perhaps this is but a coincidental occurrence or, perhaps something larger is afoot in the risk trade but, at this point, a quick rush of selling showed up in US equity indices. This comes just after yesterday’s massive breakout in USD/JPY which, itself, tracks a strong bullish breakout in Gold. All of this is happening as the US Dollar pushes up to fresh three-year-highs as US Treasury yields tick back down to 2020 lows. $$$$Suffice it to say, caution is warranted. But, as usual, the game must go on and setups remain around the US Dollar in a variety of venues that were looked at in this webinar. $$$$USD on Tradingview.$$$$I had looked into this one on Tuesday and a similar backdrop remained today. Price action in EUR/USD has begun to fill the gap from April of 2017 but, ominously sellers have been unable to break much fresh ground. The 1.0814 Fibonacci level did come in as short-term resistance but, as yet, sellers haven’t been able to substantiate much run beyond prior lows. $$$$At this point, the item of attraction would appear to be the potential for a Friday pullback ahead of the weekend that could, possibly, allow for short-side trend strategies to come back into play. Levels around 1.0863, 1.0890 or perhaps even 1.0925 could remain of interest for as such. Outside of that, the big zone of prior support around the 1.1000 psychological level hasn’t yet been tested for resistance, and this could be a workable item should a stronger rally begin to show. $$$$EUR/USD on Tradingview.$$$$At this stage, a deduction of drivers would suggest that fear of Japanese recessionary pressure is pushing in a frame of Yen-weakness. There was a nasty machine orders data release a couple of days ago, just ahead of the USD/JPY breakout, so that syncs up. There’s also the fear of a greater risk due to Coronavirus spread, so perhaps this is just a potent cocktail of fear meshing up with bad data, creating a significant market move. But, at this stage, the prior safe-haven scenario that I was looking at for Yen-strength is no longer workable nor attractive, so its time to adapt. $$$$From the USD/JPY chart, if additional stretch does show – there’s short-side potential; taken from a resistance zone that capped the 2019 swing high, taken from around the 112.50 psychological level. $$$$USD/JPY on Tradingview.$$$$I had looked into this one earlier today as there’s a workable scenario on either side of the equation. Longer-term, bearish swing potential remains as prices have held resistance around the November swing-high. Shorter-term, however, and there would be a few factors of strength in consideration, key of which has been the build of a falling wedge after that resistance test, coupled with the inclusion of support as taken from the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 2018-2019 major move in the pair. $$$$USD/CAD on Tradingview.$$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.
Euro Dollar Forecast: EUR/USD Risks to Resurface Amid Weekend Italian Election	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/01/24/Euro-Dollar-Forecast-EURUSD-Risks-to-Resurface-Amid-Weekend-Italian-Election.html	1579857000	EUR/USD | Italian Concerns Resurface $$$$Italian Regional Election in Focus.$$$$Snap Election to Put Euro on the Backfoot.	EUR/USD Analysis and Talking Points.$$$$Italy is back on the agenda for the Euro after 5 Star Party Leader Di Maio announced his decision to step down earlier this week. With this coming before a decisive regional election in Emilia-Romagna on Sunday, risk premium attached to Italy could be on the rise amid concerns over the stability of the 5SM + PD coalition.$$$$Emilia-Romagna is typically a centre-left stronghold and thus the PD party would be expected to win the regional election. However, given the sizeable lead in the national opinion polling for Salvini’s League party and with regional opinion polls showing the centre-left and centre-right are neck and neck, there is an increasingly risk that the centre-left rule could be replaced for the first time in over 70 years, which would mark a huge achievement for Salvini’s. In turn, this would heighten concerns that Italy could be on course for another election in the near-term thus placing pressure on the Euro, as well as Italian assets (FTSE MIB + BTPs).$$$$In recent months, foreign investors have stepped up their exposure to Italian debt, therefore rising risks that Italy could once again be heading back to the polls provides us with greater confidence a widening of the Bund/BTP spread towards 200bps will see Italian assets underperform, making EUR/JPY an attractive option on the downside.$$$$Source: IG Charts.$$$$--- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst.$$$$Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX.
Correction Conundrum in the US Dollar: EUR/USD, USD/CAD, AUD/USD	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/01/07/correction-conundrum-in-the-us-dollar-eur-usd-usd-cad-aud-usd-js57.html	1578426420	The US Dollar sold off to fresh five-month-lows on the final trading day of last year; and has since built into a range with a bullish bias as taken from an upward sloping trendline. $$$$This carries correction potential which can be spanned across a number of major pairs; many of which were looked at in this archived webinar with a few highlights shared below. 	It was a loud finish to 2019 for the US Dollar as the currency folded down to a fresh five-month-low on the final trading day of last year. Support showed up around a longer-term Fibonacci level at 96.47, similar to what had shown previously in December. This collection of underside wicks combined with the area at which they’re printing can make short-term bearish scenarios of challenge and may even keep the door open for near-term bullish scenarios. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; US Dollar on Tradingview.$$$$On a shorter-term basis, the US Dollar has thus far spent 2020 trade within a range formation. Resistance has held from around a prior zone of support taken from 97.05-97.20; and support has shown at an upward-sloping trendline, leading to the build of an ascending wedge-like formation. This can also point to the potential for short-term strength, which would remain as a corrective move in the longer-term bearish scenario around the USD. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; US Dollar on Tradingview.$$$$EUR/USD has had an interesting zone of resistance back in-play for over a year now, as the November 2018 swing-low was set just above the 1.1212 Fibonacci level. Last year saw a number of interesting items at this spot on the chart, including swing lows in March and April, resistance in May, support (again) in June and finally resistance in early-August, just before bears re-took control of the matter. $$$$Yesterday saw this zone come back in as resistance, as discussed in the early-morning article on the US Dollar. That resistance held and sellers took another swing this morning; helping to keep the door open for short-term bearish strategies in the pair. This could remain one of the more interesting near-term candidates to work with USD-strength. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; EURUSD on Tradingview.$$$$In a twist of irony, USD/CAD finally tested below the vaulted 1.3000 level on the final trading day of last year. Two separate incidents earlier in 2019 looked promising to bring in a sub 1.3000 print, with each failing as price action was mere pips away. This took place in July and then again in November. This can keep the door open for bearish scenarios in the pair, with the primary challenge at this point being to catch lower-high resistance. Such potential exists around 1.3042, 1.3065, 1.3102 and 1.3132. After that, the question must be asked as to whether something in the backdrop has shifted. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview.$$$$I had also looked into this pair yesterday, somewhat surprised at the late-year strength that drove AUD/USD back-above the .7000 handle. This runs in stark contrast to the bearish backdrop that had become so commonplace since January of 2018. But – that theme of strength has quickly unraveled over the past 24 hours as the RBA has hinted towards future softening. At this stage, bearish strategies may soon come back into order on the pair. A zone of lower-high resistance potential exists around .6930. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; AUDUSD on Tradingview.$$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.

USD Price Outlook: US Dollar Finds Resistance Inside of Big Level	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/01/14/usd-price-outlook-us-dollar-finds-resistance-ahead-of-a-big-level-js57.html	1579032000	The US Dollar is holding resistance inside of the ‘key’ 97.70 level on DXY. $$$$USD has put in a short-term range after last week’s bullish move; keeping the door open for near-term trend strategies, and pairs like AUD/USD may hold some allure for long-USD scenarios. 	The US Dollar has extended its 2020 bullish run following last week’s ascending triangle break. As looked at in last Tuesday’s webinar, the late-2019 sell-off saw the USD push down to fresh five month lows. But early 2020 trade did not see that move continue as a upward-sloping trendline was matched with horizontal resistance taken from an area of prior support. $$$$A bullish breakout followed, and prices continued to track up to the 97.50 area on the chart; at which point a short-term range began to develop between 97.33-97.50. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; US Dollar on Tradingview.$$$$On a longer-term basis, bearish appeal could remain around the prospect of prices holding at lower-high resistance. This is inside of the 97.70 level that had functioned as the yearly high in 2018 and again in the first-half of 2019. Support could be followed from the resistance zone looked at in last week’s ascending triangle, taken from around 97.04-97.20. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; US Dollar on Tradingview.$$$$I had looked at this one last week on both Tuesday and Thursday, focusing in on levels produced by a Fibonacci retracement drawn from last June’s swing high down to last October’s swing-low. The 38.2% retracement of that major move came into play last week to help set support around the familiar 1.1082 level. The 50% marker came into play after last week’s NFP report, helping to hold the highs on the pair. This keeps EUR/USD in a longer-term pattern of congestion and traders would likely want to adopt one of two approaches: Either trading for shorter-term swings with more near-term analysis or, alternatively, waiting for price action to break out in order to work with a more decisive trending backdrop. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; EURUSD on Tradingview.$$$$GBP/USD attempted to put in a breakdown below wedge support and the 1.3000 psychological level earlier this morning. That move has been rebuffed, however, and buyers are making a come back as Cable trades back-above the psychological level. There’s some remaining unfilled gap that runs from the approximate 1.3045-1.3055, and this could be an item of interest. A push up to, and a hold of resistance in this area, can re-open the door for bearish strategies. A push above, however, can put the focus back on to the long side of the pair. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; GBPUSD on Tradingview.$$$$Of key consideration, if there is to be a bullish resolution to the longer-term bull pennant formation, buyers have their work cut out for them, and this could offer ample opportunity for trend strategies to re-focus on the long side of GBP/USD. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; EURUSD on Tradingview.$$$$I had looked into this one earlier this morning, as well as last Friday on the heels of the NFP/Canadian jobs releases. Last week saw prices soften from a key area of resistance around 1.3100. But sellers couldn’t hold the move for long, as swing support showed up at 1.3025. Since then, buyers have held the line of higher-lows, leading to the build of a short-term ascending triangle formation. This keeps the door open for near-term bullish breakouts, which could bring into play more interesting levels of resistance potential; such as the zone from 1.3132-1.3150 or, perhaps even the zone running from 1.3181-1.3205. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview.$$$$I had looked at this one last Thursday ahead of NFP. At the time, AUD/USD had built in a range around near-term support. Of interest was a prior support swing at a key area on the chart, around .6930. That level has since come into play and is currently showing as short-term resistance, keeping the pair as a potential venue to work with USD-strength scenarios. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; AUDUSD on Tradingview.$$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.

USD/CAD rallied strongly on Wednesday, but was followed by a test of a trend-line from 2017 that turned into a mini failure. The reversal yesterday could spell some short-term weakness at the least. A close above 13171 will negate the reversal. $$$$It’s been a see-saw market with rallies fading and sell-offs reversing, which means the current leg up is at risk. One of these days a move will sustain, but until we see signs of a one-way move staying that way, we will need to continue to trade the price action for what it is.$$$$USD/CAD Chart by TradingView.$$$$EUR/USDmay have finally broken the support that it needed to in order for it to gain some momentum. The trend-line off the October low was broken decisively, and while there is some price support around 11000 to watch the broader downtrend suggests a test is in order of the lows from October created under 10900. $$$$EUR/USD Chart by TradingView.$$$$AUD/USDis currently sitting on a fairly important trend threshold. The tend-line (lower parallel) rising up from the October low is under siege, and with the way it is lacking any interest so far, suggests it could soon break. However, it is important to wait for it to actually break before running too aggressively with a bearish bias. It’s support until it’s not.

A lot of moving parts currently pushing EUR/USD price action with the majority being negative. From a fundamental point of view, news that Luigi di Maio will step down as leader of the Five Star movement has weighed on the single currency, while the latest broadside from US President Trump that he will put a 25% tariff on EU autos if the two sides are unable to make a deal, brings trade wars back into focus. The EU have said that they will push ahead with the proposed digital tax, leaving an escalation in the dispute between the two sides likely.$$$$Euro Under Dark Clouds as Trump Threatens Auto Tariffs.$$$$This week will see the latest ECB monetary policy announcement (Thursday) and accompanying press conference and the first look at sentiment in the Euro-Zone via the Markit manufacturing, services and composite PMIs on Friday. Tuesday’s ZEW releases, all better than expected, showed a strong rebound in Euro-Zone optimism and Euro bulls will be looking for more of the same on Friday. The ECB are fully expected to leave all monetary policy levers untouched on Thursday, but President Christine Lagarde may give more details about the central bank’s strategic review into the effectiveness of its monetary policy and how it affects the ECB’s price stability mandate.$$$$Today’s break lower and one-month low print suggests that sellers remain in control of price-action. While it can be argued that the longer-term outlook for the Euro is positive, the breaking of a series of lower highs and new lower lows from late October, the short-term set-up suggests a re-test of 1.1000. The pair are trading below all three moving averages and may further selling will bring 1.1065 and then 1.1040 in play before the short-term target of the 1.0981 – 1.0989 zone comes into view.

FX Price Action: Wait for the Major Breaks or Look Between the Swings	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/01/16/fx-price-action-wait-for-the-major-breaks-or-look-bw-the-swings-js57.html	1579204800	The US Dollar is showing little for trend at the moment. $$$$Traders have two choices: Either be patient and wait for a break or look to trade smaller moves inside of recent swings. 	The US Dollar remains in a, lets call it a ‘trendless’ state after recovering from the late-year sell-off. USD has displayed little trend-side direction of recent and prices continued that theme earlier this morning after getting a quick bump off of a near-term support zone. And given this lack of vol in the USD, many major pairs are in similar spots, trading inside of recent swings or ranges that leave little of interest for trend or breakout scenarios. $$$$This leaves traders with two options: Either be patient and wait for potentially major moves to begin to show or, alternatively, work inside of those recent swings. I looked at a series of USD-pairs in this webinar in the effort of addressing each market appropriately. $$$$Last week’s recovery in the US Dollar appears to have run its course although neither buyers nor sellers look ready to make a concerted push in USD price action. On a short-term basis, and looking inside of those swings, a hold of resistance around the 97.36 level can keep the door open for bearish USD-plays. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; US Dollar on Tradingview.$$$$I had looked into this one earlier this morning and, amongst major pairs, this may be one of the more attractive scenarios that may lead to a ‘bigger picture’ break. $$$$The bullish theme in Cable ran loudly through Q4 with aggressive bullish breakouts showing in October and December. After the December move, with price action finding resistance at 1.3000, prices ranged into December, at which point another breakout showed up. Since that one, however, price action has narrowed within a symmetrical wedge formation, making for a bull pennant. With buyers pushing prices up to trendline resistance, the door may soon open for continuation of that Q4 theme of GBP-strength. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; GBPUSD on Tradingview.$$$$Going along with that lacking volatility in the USD, EUR/USD has remained in range for most of 2020 thus far. There may be a short-term bullish theme brewing, however, and this could keep the door open for short-term setups. Resistance at 1.1187-1.1212 shouldn’t be dismissed, and this could cap near-term topside targets. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; EURUSD on Tradingview.$$$$Impasse may soon be ready to break in USD/CAD as next Wednesday brings a couple of high-impact drivers. Price action in the pair, at this point, is fairly equalized with little recent trend to work with. Strategy was discussed in the session, and this could be a big focal point for next week. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview.$$$$On the long side of the US Dollar, AUD/USD can remain attractive. Of importance is the level around .6930, which has been both recent resistance as well as short-term support from early 2020 trade. That price has been followed in the past few webinars for lower-high resistance, which may have shown up today. This can keep the door open for a push down towards .6850 after which the .6800 level becomes of interest. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; AUDUSD on Tradingview.$$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.
ECB Leaves Rates Unchanged, As Expected; Euro Stable	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/01/23/ECB-Leaves-Rates-Unchanged-As-Expected-Euro-Stable.html	1579784400	The European Central Bank has left all its key interest rates unchanged, as was widely expected, and its bond-buying program at €20 billion per month.$$$$Also as expected, the ECB has confirmed that it will launch a strategic review of topics ranging from its inflation target to climate change.$$$$In response, EUR/USD held steady as ECB President Christine Lagarde explained the decisions at a press conference.	The European Central Bank has confirmed a strategic policy review that could lead to a change in its current inflation target of below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Other topics could include digital currencies and climate change and the review could take a year to complete.$$$$The statement came as the ECB left all its key interest rates and its €20 billion per month asset-purchase program where they were, as widely expected by analysts polled by the news agencies. That left EUR/USD little changed during a press conference by ECB President Christine Lagarde.$$$$Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)$$$$Lagarde was listened to closely for indications on whether she would follow the ultra-easy monetary policies of her predecessor Mario Draghi amid doubts among some members of its rate-setting Governing Council about the efficacy of keeping the monetary taps wide open amid early signs of an improvement in the Eurozone economy.$$$$In the meantime, the ECB said it sees interest rates at their present or lower levels until the inflation outlook converges robustly to its target. It also said it sees its asset-purchase program running for as long as necessary and to end shortly before any rate increase.$$$$It will reinvest the proceeds of the program in full for an extended time after that rate hike and for as long as necessary. Further details of the scope and timetable of the strategic review will be published at 1430 GMT.$$$$Speaking at her press conference, Lagarde said incoming economic data were in line with the ECB's baseline scenario of ongoing moderate growth, although manufacturing was a drag.$$$$Monetary policy has to remain highly accomodative for a prolonged period of time but the Eurozone services and construction sectors remained resilient and both surveys and offiial data pointed to some stabilization, she said.$$$$Risks are tilted to the downside, but less pronounced, while headline inflation is likely to stay around its current levels in coming months, Lagarde added. $$$$--- Written by Martin Essex, Analyst and Editor.$$$$Feel free to contact me via the comments section below.
Dollar, Yen Crosses and Global Indices Test Resistance as Dow Extends Rally	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/01/17/Dollar-Yen-Crosses-and-Global-Indices-Test-Resistance-as-Dow-Extends-Rally.html	1579233600	The Phase One trade deal was used as justification for extending the Dow and S&P 500 rally.$$$$Growth is a top theme to end the week with Chinese 4Q GDP on tap.$$$$Deciding your view on range, breakout or trend conditions is important with key tech level in view.	There is still an afterglow from the United State and China’s official signing of the Phase One trade deal – never mind the very open skepticism around what the agreement actually offers in tangible growth. As a recap, China signaled it would increase purchases of US goods (US sources say $200 billion worth) and monitor intellectual property rights while the US removed its currency manipulator status against its counterpart and rides off its avoiding tariff escalation in October and December. This doesn’t address matters such as Huawei and policing technology transfers, but the biggest red flag against growth is the maintenance of the $360 billion in goods being taxed at the two countries’ borders. There is much that can be questioned in this development, but the market behind the US indices have not been in a questioning mood. The Dow and S&P 500 gapped higher on Thursday’s open and continued readily to fresh record highs through the end of the session. $$$$Chart of DIA with 20-Day Moving Average and Gaps (Daily)$$$$Chart Created with TradingView Platform.$$$$I remain dubious of the general sentiment view offered up by the US stock market itself. There remains a large deviation in performance between he like of the Dow and many other assets with a risk designation. Perhaps one of the most appropriate comparisons for contrast is the performance of global indices. I like to reference the VEU ‘rest of world’ ETF, but there is a notable posturing below resistance for the German DAX, UK FTSE100 and Japanese Nikkei 225. Further afield, emerging markets, carry trade and commodities are similarly showing a lack of outright speculative appetite as well as confidence that the global economy has changed its course for the better. Other highlights for global trade include the USMCA vote in the Senate which didn’t seem to budget the Canadian Dollar or Mexican peso significantly. In contrast, concern that the US will turn its gaze onto Europe after months of threats seems to be gaining serious traction. Perhaps that is further tempering the Euro and European indices. $$$$Chart of DAX Index with 100-Day Moving Average (Daily)$$$$Chart Created with IG Trading Platform.$$$$Looking ahead to the final 24 hours of this trading week, there are a few more fundamental sparks to mind; but the burden to override complacency remains particularly high. At the top of the market Richter Scale is the Chinese 4Q GDP release. The health of the second largest economy in the world and the target of the onerous trade war is naturally a top priority for those monitoring the vitals of the global economy and financial markets. That said, this series has a notorious history of surprisingly small moves and even smaller ‘surprises’ (relative to forecast) from quarter to quarter. Nevertheless, with the economy running at its slowest pace in decades, even measured moves can draw serious concern. Other growth measures like European construction, UK retail sales and US consumer confidence (UofM) will register, but the impact will be shaped by the twilight of liquidity. It isn’t impossible to move markets, but the surprise may need to be bigger to register. $$$$Chart of USDCNH and 20-Day Moving Average (Daily)$$$$Chart Created with IG Trading Platform.$$$$Another theme of merit this past session - and more heavily into the next trading week - is monetary policy. This past session, the European Central Bank (ECB) released the minutes of their previous meeting. Among the various highlights was the repeated concern among a few members that the group more closely track the detrimental side effects of extreme accommodation. This is a serious concern among traders that are mindful of the confidence built on this decade of external support and the concept seems to be slowly seeping into the minds of the people directing the aid. There is considerable weight afforded to accommodative monetary policy and is ability to buoy risk trends. If this conviction falters or the naturally receding tide in the markets overwhelms their capabilities, the effect can be severe. Looking further ahead to next week, the ECB and BOJ – two of the most dovish major central banks – will inform the strategy at the lower bound. $$$$As discussed yesterday, it is important to determine where you stand on the status of the broader financial markets – whether it is fundamentally range, breakout or trend oriented. That is not to say there aren’t outliers or areas more prone to a different type relative to the majority; but the idea is to find the most ubiquitous conditions to favor probabilities. In my poll, conducted in Twitter, the majority (40%) thought that we were currently supporting trends. Those voting for range and breakout were evenly split (30%). I fall in the category supporting ranges. The favorite exception to this is also the leading example for risk trends: US indices. While the S&P 500 has advanced these past three months, the pace has been particularly restrained. In fact, conditions are so restrained that it has been 67 consecutive trading sessions since the benchmark has experienced a 1 percent movement either higher or lower. There are only four other instances of quiet to that magnitude in roughly the past four decades. That doesn’t feel like a trend backdrop.$$$$If I’m looking for range scenarios, there are explicit risk assets that can qualify. However, my interests lean more towards the Dollar and Yen crosses. For the DXY Index, we have seen a descending channel resistance rejection this past session that transfers directly over from the likes of EURUSD and GBPUSD. In contrast, the Yen crosses fall within that grey area where some would say they are on the cusp of a breakout and others are expecting the technical ceiling to hold and send the markets back along the path of least resistance. EURJPY, GBPJPY and CADJPY may seem like short-term breakout candidates, but the big picture holds their conformity to bounds that are years in the making. Combining the Dollar and Yen and we have a pair on the cusp. USDJPY is testing 110 which is the upper bound of a symmetrical triangle that is over six years in the making.

EUR/USD Breaks Down, Oil Tests Key Support as Risk-Off Hints Appear	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/01/23/eurusd-breaks-down-oil-tests-key-support-as-risk-off-hints-appear-js57.html	1579809600	This webinar looked at price action setups across USD-pairs along with Oil and Gold. $$$$The notable item from this morning has been a fresh 2020 low in EUR/USD. 	Probably the most notable event from this morning has been a breakdown in the Euro. This morning brought an ECB rate decision into the mix; and Christine Lagarde didn’t really say anything either hawkish or dovish (she does identify as an owl, after all), but the single currency was able to push down to a fresh 2020 low after holding at a key area of support over the past couple of trading days. $$$$Bearish continuation approaches could be complicated by a big batch of support sitting underneath current price action, running around the 1.1000 psychological level that had come into play to help hold the lows in December of last year. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; EURUSD on Tradingview.$$$$As looked at in the Euro forecast for this week, EUR/JPY may have offered a more amenable backdrop for Euro bears, as resistance had just started to show off of a bearish trendline projection. That resistance has held and sellers have made their way back this week, driven by a bit of risk aversion that appears to be emanating from the Coronavirus scenario. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; EURJPY on Tradingview.$$$$The first chart looked at in today’s webinar was for WTI Crude Oil, which has seen a very visible downside move develop this week. While price action started the week with a quick resistance check up to a Fibonacci level at 59.64, sellers have remained in-control ever since, driving prices all the way down to the 55-handle. At this point, reversal potential could possibly be attractive; chasing the move-lower could be of difficulty. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; Crude Oil on Tradingview.$$$$Going along with that Yen-strength, the US Dollar has been bid so far today, helping DXY to test a key area on the chart that runs from 97.70-97.86. This is the same zone that helped to catch the highs in late-December, and prices have quickly reverted back to this zone. This can potentially open the door for reversal scenarios, which may be seen as attractive in pairs like GBP/USD or perhaps even USD/CAD. For bullish USD-continuation scenarios, AUD/USD can remain as attractive. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; US Dollar on Tradingview.$$$$I had looked at this one on Twitter a couple of times over the past two days, noting a support test at a prior Fibonacci level and, this morning, a series of lower-highs that’s developed since. This brought potential for a deeper pullback, which has started to show, and the next natural question is whether higher-low support may soon develop. There are two nearby zones of note, the nearest of which runs from 1.3075-1.3084, and a bit deeper is a prior zone of support around the 1.3037 level.$$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; GBPUSD on Tradingview.$$$$Yesterday brought a couple of Canadian drivers into the mix with the early-morning CPI release followed by a Bank of Canada rate decision. The net impact was a sell-off in the Loonie as USD/CAD pushed up to fresh highs, breaking above a key resistance point around 1.3100 in the process. As of this morning, the pair was attempting to hold higher-low support; but sellers have continued to push and prices have scaled-back. $$$$This opens the door to a couple of possible scenarios: For longer-term approaches, short-side swings, looking for reversals could remain a possible approach. On a shorter-term basis, looking for support at that prior area of resistance around 1.3100 could keep the door open for topside trend strategies.$$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview.$$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.

Pre-FOMC Price Action Setups Around the US Dollar: GBP/USD, USD/CAD	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2020/01/28/pre-fomc-price-action-setups-around-the-us-dollar-usdcad-gbpusd.html	1580241720	Tomorrow brings the first FOMC rate decision of 2020. $$$$There are minimal expectations for any actual moves but quite a bit of divergence in expectations for later this year. $$$$Clues and hints will be carefully watched for and this will likely set the tone in the US Dollar. 	Tomorrow brings the first Federal Reserve rate decision in 2020 and there are minimal expectations for any actual change. Nonetheless, current probabilities indicate an approximate one-in-eight chance of a 25 basis point hike. This contradicts expectations for later in the year, as there’s a current 72.1% chance of at least one cut and a 35.3% chance of at least two rate cuts by the end of 2020. $$$$So, as has become usual, the importance will be in the details of tomorrow’s statement and accompanying press conference; after which market participants will further gauge the potential for rate moves out of the bank later in the year. $$$$The US Dollar has clawed back a large portion of those December losses, and additional resistance potential sits overhead in the 98.33-98.50 zone on DXY. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; US Dollar on Tradingview.$$$$EUR/USD is back to testing the same support that came into play to help hold the November lows, taken from around the 1.1000 psychological level. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley.$$$$Similarly, GBP/USD is testing a confluent area of support around a key psychological level, taken from around the 1.3000 handle on the pair. This same price helped to set resistance in October as that bullish breakout took a pause. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley.$$$$USD/CAD has continued to rally into this week, intersecting with a big zone of resistance running from 1.3181-1.3205. That area has helped to hold the highs and that can keep the door open for short-side strategies going into tomorrow. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley.$$$$--- Written by James Stanley, Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow James on Twitter: @JStanleyFX.
EUR/USD Forecast - Battling Short-Term Technical Indicators	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/12/23/EURUSD-Forecast-Battling-Short-Term-Technical-Indicators.html	1577097900	EUR/USD moving sideways in a very-thin market.$$$$Traders should adopt a wait-and-see stance.	EUR/USD is struggling in holiday-thinned market conditions with the upside seemingly blocked by the 20-day moving average cutting across around 1.1100 big figure level. Last Friday’s slump through this indicator added a negative bias to the pair with this candle’s range of 1.1066 – 1.1124 likely to hold during the upcoming holiday. The downside is protected by the 50-dma at 1.1077 but this may come under pressure if US dollar strength continues into the year-end, leaving 1.1066 vulnerable. Holiday-thinned markets can prove tricky and it may be best to watch any moves from the sidelines until liquidity returns.$$$$EUR/USD Technical Analysis – Euro Struggling to Break Higher.$$$$Thin market conditions may help a downside break, especially as the US dollar remains in demand going into the year-end. While the latest CoT Report shows some USD longs being pared back, the Fed remains concerned about USD liquidity and recently announced that it will provide $500 billion of liquidity via overnight and term repos. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced last week a supply of reserves ‘to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation’. $$$$Economic data out later in the session includes US durable goods orders for November which are expected to pick-up to 1.5% from October’s 0.5%.

Pre-NFP Price Action Setups Across the US Dollar	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/12/05/Pre-NFP-price-action-setups-across-the-US-Dollar-js56.html	1575575280	The US Dollar has continued to sell-off ahead of tomorrow’s NFP report. $$$$Short-term oversold conditions are showing around the USD – might tomorrow’s jobs report help to provide a bounce up to lower-high resistance? $$$$DailyFX Forecasts are published on a variety of markets such as Gold, the US Dollar or the Euro and are available from the DailyFX Trading Guides page. If you’re looking to improve your trading approach, check out Traits of Successful Traders. And if you’re looking for an introductory primer to the Forex market, check out our New to FX Guide.	The US Dollar has continued to sell-off in December and the three-month-low lurks just beneath current price action around the 97.11 level that came into play in early-November. $$$$Tomorrow brings Non-Farm Payrolls so there will certainly be motive for USD trends. The big question is whether a short-term oversold scenario in the USD might allow for a deeper sell-off, or whether prices pose a pullback that could allow for re-entry into the bearish USD trend that’s started to play-out in Q4 of this year. $$$$For pullback potential around tomorrow’s NFP report, the 97.70 level on DXY remains of interest, as this was the prior annual high set in November and December of last year, going along with 2019 resistance inflections in both March and June. This same price offered support in November and again on Tuesday but, to date, hasn’t been tested for resistance. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; US Dollar on Tradingview.$$$$Longer-term resistance lurks in EUR/USD around 1.1187-1.1212 and this could be a constraint for bullish stances. But, on a shorter-term basis, buyers haven’t yet thrown in the towel, and if that pullback scenario plays out in USD tomorrow, a similar backdrop could develop around the EUR/USD. In the pair, the price of 1.1083 has been impactful but on a short-term basis hasn’t yet been tested for support after previously functioning as resistance. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; EURUSD on Tradingview.$$$$On Tuesday the pair had already broken out to fresh six-month-highs and was catching a bit of resistance at a longer-term Fibonacci level around 1.3117. That resistance did not hold for long, however, as buyers have just continued to push. At this point, there’s little evidence to suggest that reversals are in-play and bullish continuation can be a challenge given the veracity of this recent move; so much so that a 1.3000 support test appears very far away and even if it does happen, something has likely shifted in the backdrop. This does, however, keep open the possibility of looking for support to play-in at that prior point of resistance around 1.3117 for aggressive topside strategies.$$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; GBPUSD on Tradingview.$$$$Tomorrow brings Canadian jobs data out at the same 8:30 AM ET block that US jobs numbers will be released, thereby making for a potentially tumultuous backdrop in the pair; and over the past couple of days a workable trend has shown in the pair after the Bank of Canada rate decision yesterday. $$$$While the pair had previously remained stubbornly strong even as USD was tanking in early-December, longer-term resistance lurking above combined with a less-dovish outlay from the BoC yesterday helped to bring sellers back into USD/CAD. The drawback at this point is nearby support and a potentially oversold short-term dynamic; opening the door for pullback potential to prior areas of support such as 1.3208-1.3222 or perhaps as deep as 1.3250-1.3262. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; USDCAD on Tradingview.$$$$USD/CHF has been in a range through the duration of Q4 and price action is sitting just atop range support, keeping the door open for bullish strategies. $$$$Chart prepared by James Stanley; USDCHF on Tradingview.$$$$To read more: $$$$Are you looking for longer-term analysis on the U.S. Dollar?

EUR/USD Price Ignores Better-Than-Expected Euro-Zone Inflation Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/11/29/EURUSD-Price-Ignores-Better-Than-Expected-Euro-Zone-Inflation-Data-.html	1575028800	Euro-Zone trumps expectations.$$$$EUR/USD weakness still evident on the daily chart.	Brand New Q4 2019 USD and EUR Forecast and Top Trading Opportunities.$$$$Euro-Zone inflation increased in November with the headline number printing at 1.0%, up from a prior 0.7%, while the core figure was released at 1.3%, up from 1.1% in October. The uptick was driven primarily by services prices, although, ex-fuel, prices were marginally higher across the board. While the move higher will please the ECB, inflation remains below the central bank’s target. However, if price pressures continue to pick-up, the hawks on the ECB monetary policy committee may start to become more vocal, leaving ECB President Lagarde looking at a growth/inflation balancing act in the months to come.$$$$The single-currency barely moved on the inflation release and remains at 1.1000 against the US dollar. Markets are quiet with the US off yesterday and in, at best, for half-a-day today, while EURUSD volatility is at multi-months lows. Support levels remain unchanged at 1.09891 and 1.0926, ahead of the October 1 low at 1.0879. The spot price remains under all three moving averages, highlighting the pairs ongoing weakness, and if the price breaks lower next week on any of the important US data releases, all three support levels may fall.$$$$There are a cluster of previous highs, along with the 20- and 50-dmas, blocking the upside back to 1.1100 and the pair will need a strong stimulus to test this level.$$$$For all the major economic data releases and the updated events schedule, see the DailyFX Economic Calendar. $$$$The  IG Client Sentiment shows that traders are 57% net-long EUR/USD, giving us a bearish contrarian bias.$$$$EUR/USD Daily Price Chart (March - November 29, 2019)$$$$Traders may be interested in two of our trading guides – Traits of Successful Traders and Top Trading Lessons – while technical analysts are likely to be interested in our latest Elliott Wave Guide.$$$$What is your view on the Euro and the US Dollar – bullish or bearish??

By all accounts, it appears that a new front will open in the US-led trade wars.$$$$“The United States Trade Representative is in the process of completing its investigation, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, of France’s Digital Services Tax (DST) and intends to issue its report in that investigation on Monday, December 2, 2019. At that time, the United States Trade Representative also will announce any proposed action in the investigation.”$$$$Much like the reaction of the Chinese Yuan around negative US-China trade war headlines, the Euro took a dive below 1.1000 versus the US Dollar during the thinly-traded pre-Thanksgiving holiday session. There has been some speculation that a response to the French digital tax may only be the beginning of an expanded EU-US trade war.

The European Central Bank’s Governing Council confirmed predictions Thursday by leaving all its benchmark interest rates unchanged: the deposit rate at -0.5%, the marginal lending rate at 0.25% and the refinancing rate at 0.0%. There was also no change in its asset-purchase program, which restarted in November at €20 billion per month.$$$$In a statement, the ECB said it expects interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook converge robustly to a level sufficiently close to but below 2% within its projection horizon and such convergence has been reflected consistently in underlying inflation dynamics.$$$$As for its asset purchases, the ECB said it expects them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its interest rates and to end them shortly before it starts raising interest rates.$$$$Speaking at her first post-decision press conference, new ECB President Christine Lagarde said the ECB would conduct a strategic review starting in January. However, she gave few more details beyond saying it should be completed by the end of 2020.$$$$Meanwhile, ECB staff projections for both GDP growth and inflation were little changed from the September projections although Lagarde said that economic data point to continued muted inflation pressures and signs of stabilization in the slowdown of Eurozone economic growth.$$$$Highly accommodative monetary policy was still needed, she added, with the risks to growth tilted to the downside. She also urged Eurozone governments to ease fiscal policy. $$$$In response, EUR/USD was barely changed.$$$$Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)$$$$In the money markets prior to the latest rate decision, the implied likelihood of the deposit rate being left at -0.5% was 83%, with a 17% chance of a small cut to -0.6%.

If today’s US non-manufacturing/services ISM – released at 15:00 GMT - is equally as downbeat, EUR/USD should push through recent resistance levels and back towards the double-top made in late-October and early-November.

Dow Jones & DAX 30 Outlook: German Stocks to Close the Gap?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/12/13/Dow-Jones-DAX-30-Outlook-German-Stocks-to-Close-the-Gap.html	1576270800	The Dow Jones surged to record levels on the back of a dovish FOMC rate decision and hopeful trade war headlines.$$$$The DAX 30 enjoyed a similar reaction as ECB head Christine Lagarde alluded to the use of fiscal policy as a method of stimulating the Eurozone’s economy.$$$$Compared to the potential Potemkin Village of a trade deal in the US, the DAX 30 could be positioned to outpace the Dow Jones in the weeks ahead.	Risk appetite roared in the early hours of Friday’s trading session as China confirmed it reached a phase one trade deal with the United States. Still devoid of detail, however, optimism was reeled in as investors took stock of what was actually delivered. Now, market participants may require concrete figures and enforceable terms before embarking on the next leg higher. $$$$Consequently, the DAX 30 could look to outperform the Dow Jones after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson secured an outright conservative majority and Christine Lagarde, now head of the ECB, hinted at fiscal policy as a route of stimulating the European economy. $$$$Dow Jones to DAX 30 ratio overlaid in red. Chart created with TradingView.$$$$Given the fundamental forces facing Germany and the United States, the former has been granted a relatively greater degree of certainty. While a trade breakdown would undoubtedly undercut the DAX 30 alongside the Dow Jones, the nature of the two assets could allow for an intriguing trading opportunity, looking for bearish Dow positions while favoring long exposure to the DAX 30 and capturing the differential between the two. $$$$Therefore, the position would be hedged against broader uptick in risk aversion, while possessing the opportunity to capitalize on an equity extension higher – relying on the DAX 30 to outpace the Dow Jones given the fundamental forces at play.  $$$$Chart created with TradingView.$$$$Another investment vehicle that may offer access to the same themes is EUR/USD. As it stands, the Euro has much to gain from changes in fiscal policy and relative Brexit clarity. The US Dollar has suffered a string of declines in December thus far via the Dollar Basket Index (DXY), falling comfortably beneath its 200-day moving average. Thus, EUR/USD may continue to exhibit strength as the Dollar wrestles with a dovish Federal Reserve and trade war headlines. $$$$Chart created with TradingView.$$$$With that in mind, EUR/USD could take aim at resistance posed by the 61.8% Fibonacci level around 1.1864. Subsequent areas of interest could reside around 1.1250 which has been an area of contention for the pair throughout 2019.

EUR/USD is attempting to push higher in early trade and may get some support from the 200-dma (the black line on the daily chart), a technical indicator that has proved difficult for the pair to break convincingly. A look back at EUR/USD over the year shows the 200-dma has capped upside progress, apart from a couple of false breaks, and traders should wait to see if today’s open above this long-term indicator holds. Holiday-thinned trade will not help the pair.$$$$Last Friday’s sell-off candle is also acting as a short-term range guide between 1.1111 and 1.1187 with additional resistance from a cluster of prior highs between 1.1173 and 1.1179 made between October 18 and November 4. Last Thursday’s high print at 1.1200 has broken a series of lower highs but again this needs to be confirmed over the next few days to embolden EUR/USD bulls.$$$$There are a few important economic releases over the rest of the week, as well as commentary from ECB President Christine Lagarde in Frankfurt Wednesday morning and ECB chief economist Philip Lane on Thursday afternoon.

Euro Outlook: EUR/USD May Reverse Gains on Eurozone GDP, CPI Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/10/31/Euro-Outlook-EURUSD-May-Reverse-Gains-on-Eurozone-GDP-CPI-Data.html	1572505200	EUR/USD could pare recent gains.$$$$Downtrend in the pair still in play.$$$$Eurozone GDP, CPI data on deck.	Learn how to use political-risk analysis in your trading strategy!$$$$EUR/USD may erase some of its recent upside movement if Eurozone CPI, GDP and unemployment data reinforce concerns about the region’s growth trajectory. Amid geopolitical oscillations and softer growth out of powerhouse economies – like Germany – data has been tending to underperform relative to expectations. It will therefore not be entirely surprising if these same fundamental factors lead to softer GDP and CPI prints.$$$$Seasonally adjusted year-on-year GDP data is expected to show an advanced print of 1.1 percent, marginally weaker than the prior 1.2 percent outcome. Over the same time measure, core CPI – which excludes good with high price volatility – is expected to remain unchanged at one percent. Looking at the 5Y5Y Euro inflation swap forward, markets clearly have low expectations upside price growth in the Eurozone. $$$$However, EUR/USD’s possible decline may be tempered by the release of US PMI and Core PCE data – the latter being a favorite of the Fed’s to use for calculating the policy outlook. If these indicators miss their estimates, it could magnify the US Dollar’s decline in an environment where it has been weakening amid a renewal in risk appetite and turn away from haven-linked assets. $$$$EUR/USD Price Outlook.$$$$EUR/USD recently broke through a multi-week uptrend, but the pair’s decline – at least, for now – has been saved by the recent FOMC rate decision. However, upcoming economic data could erase some of EUR/USD’s gains. While the longer-term outlook supports a downside bias, a temporary respite in haven demand may erode upside pressure in the Greenback and strengthen the EUR/USD exchange rate. $$$$Market Analysis of the Day: EUR/USD Likely to Resume Dominant Downtrend – Daily Chart $$$$EUR/USD chart created using TradingView.$$$$--- Written by Dimitri Zabelin, Jr Currency Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$To contact Dimitri, use the comments section below or @ZabelinDimitrion Twitter.

Learn how to use political-risk analysis in your trading strategy!$$$$EUR/USD may fall if critical Eurozone data saps capital away from the Euro amid a fear frenzy about the region’s growth prospects. Key indicators traders will be watching are industrial, consumer and business confidence and German CPI data; France GDP data is also on the radar. Volatility from these releases may be amplified by the FOMC rate decision, subsequent press briefing and US Q3 GDP data. $$$$Eurozone confidence data is broadly expected to show soft prints, particularly the industrial report. Globally, the manufacturing sector has been under assault from weakening growth prospects caused in large part from the US-China trade war. The contraction is becoming so severe, that economists are calling it an “industrial recession”, and it may not be too long until the weakness spills over into the services sector. $$$$As the biggest Eurozone economy – and third-largest exporter in the world – German data commands the attention of Euro traders because of what poor performance there could mean for the region. While local unemployment claims are expected to remain unchanged at 5%, preliminary year-on-year CPI is anticipated to show a one percent print, slightly weaker than the previous 1.2 percent reading. $$$$Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is like EF Hutton: when he talks, everybody listens; the caveat being markets may not appreciate what he has to say. Investors are yearning for ultra-aggressive easing expectations, and what they will likely receive is a prudent answer outlining how the central bank is data dependent. This may then lead to stronger US Dollar and weaker EUR/USD exchange rate against the backdrop of European data. $$$$Market Analysis of the Day: EUR/USD Downtrend May Accelerate After Pair Broke Through Short-Term Uptrend.$$$$EUR/USD chart created using TradingView.$$$$--- Written by Dimitri Zabelin, Jr Currency Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$To contact Dimitri, use the comments section below or @ZabelinDimitrion Twitter.

The US Dollar spiked higher right after the Federal Reserve revealed another 25-basis point interest rate cut as expected – its third in a row. The FOMC decision comes as little surprise, however, seeing that overnight swaps were pricing in a rough 95% probability that the Fed would cut rates again prior to the October meeting. The US central bank’s benchmark interest rate – the Federal funds rate (FFR) – now sits at a target range of 1.50-1.75%. $$$$While it might be expected that the US Dollar would fall following an interest rate cut from the Fed, the move was largely priced in already. Furthermore, the latest FOMC statement cut out dovish language previously detailed in the September Fed meeting press release. Specifically, the Fed removed that it would “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” which is being interpreted as a firmer monetary policy stance and creating uncertainty over the market’s priced in rate cuts for December and beyond. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$The DXY Index – a popular basket of major US Dollar currency pairs heavily weighted toward EUR/USD – jumped higher following the latest FOMC decision. Though commentary from Fed Chair Powell during the follow-up press conference sent the US Dollar whipsawing lower.$$$$USD/JPY spiked to session highs following the latest FOMC rate cut as expectations for further easing from the Fed grows less likely, but quickly pivoted back down to session lows as Fed Chair Powell provided further details on the central bank's latest stance on monetary policy.$$$$Minutes prior to the October Fed decision, rate traders were pricing in a 30.7% probability that the FOMC would cut rates for a fourth consecutive meeting down to a target FFR range of 1.25-1.50%. As markets digested the FOMC press statement and Fed Chair Powell commented further on the central bank’s latest monetary policy update, however, the probability of another 25-basis point rate cut before the end of the year dropped to a mere 18.8% chance. $$$$Powell detailed that he and the FOMC believe that the current positioning of monetary policy ‘is in a good place.’ This is of course predicated on the assumption that actual data and the US economy will evolve in line with central bank’s most recent economic projections. Fed Chair Powell said how interest rates are currently at an accommodative level with the real FFR ‘probably modestly below zero.’ $$$$Furthermore, the head central banker stated that the Fed’s outlook on the US economy is for moderate growth close to 2%. Powell added that the household sector has been strong and how consumers remain healthy. Likewise, the Fed Chair highlighted the positive shift in risk trends recently and referenced the reduced risk of no-deal Brexit and receding US-China trade tensions. $$$$Powell commented on robust labor market gains and how it is the reason the Fed hopes to sustain the expansion. He also noted how low initial jobless claims data is showing a positive sign that the employment backdrop remains on a solid foundation. Though the US Dollar began to reverse quickly when Powell mentioned FOMC officials are not considering raising rates right now and added how inflation seems to be struggling to hit the central bank’s 2% symmetric target. The reversal in USD price action was exacerbated following remarks on the importance of boosting reserves up to $1.5 trillion. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

Trump Renews Assault on the Fed, Phase One Trade Deal Doubts Rise	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/11/12/Trump-Renews-Assault-on-the-Fed-Phase-One-Trade-Deal-Doubts-Rise.html	1573586520	US President Trump’s attack on the Federal Reserve was reignited today with Trump stating that the US should have lower rates and is at a disadvantage compared to other low-rate counties.$$$$Tariffs on China will be raised ‘substantially’ if no phase one trade agreement is reached after softening language by saying a deal ‘could’ happen $$$$Trump also takes some jabs at the European Union after stating that EU trade barriers are worse than in China which pushed EURUSD to session lows.	President Trump delivered remarks on trade policy today at the Economic Club of New York. Trump continued his attack on the Fed as he harped on interest rates by saying we are in competition with countries who have negative rates. Furthermore, Trump said “We should be paying, by far, the lowest interest.”$$$$The market’s reaction was largely muted to this recurring theme seeing that Trump has previously waged not-so-subtle attacks on FOMC monetary policy being too tight and holding back the US economy. Markets were gaining broadly headed into Trump’s speech with the S&P 500 Index setting another record high with the market-cap weighted benchmark touching 3,106.20 before moving modestly lower. $$$$Sentiment around trade talks have seen an optimistic lift since the two sides reached a tentative ‘phase-one’ agreement last month. Trump said that if a deal is not made with China, tariffs would be raised significantly which set a more pessimistic tone. Markets largely ignored the negative comment as Trump has gyrated before with his public commentary on China and trade deal progress.$$$$Another jab – and arguably less expected – came when Trump remarked on the European Union’s trade policies saying that the EU has high barriers to trade and stating specifically that the EU has “terrible, terrible” barriers and in many ways is even ‘worse than China.’ The EURUSD pair dropped on the comment and speculators stepped up selling pressure on a higher probability that Trump may instigate another trade war but this time with the European Union.  $$$$As the holiday shopping season approaches in the US investors are starting to speculate that Trump may be feeling pressure to make some tangible results in trade talks with China, now approaching it’s 500th day. $$$$While impacts on the previous two holiday seasons have been muted, there may be an evident impact for the 2020 holiday shopping season as trade war conjecture has now seeped into US consumer confidence in recent months, evidenced by the University of Michigan Consumer sentiment Survey hitting its weakest mark since August 2016.$$$$But, speculation from some view the trade war as a proxy weapon for Trump to wield when attacking the Federal Reserve with his attempt to strongarm the US central bank to lower interest rates even further.  $$$$--Written by Thomas Westwater, Intern Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow Thomas on Twitter @FxWestwater.
Euro Outlook Dour Even as Germany Narrowly Avoids Recession	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/11/14/Euro.html	1573714800	Euro gains uninspired as Germany narrowly avoids a technical recession.$$$$Soggy inflation, weak growth, geopolitics likely to make for a dovish ECB.$$$$Breach of near-term chart support sets the stage to test below 1.09 figure.	Where will markets end 2019? See our Q4 forecasts for currencies, commodities and stock indexes!$$$$The Euro popped higher as third-quarter German GDP data showed the currency bloc’s largest economy unexpectedly avoided a technical recession. Output grew 0.1 percent in the three months to September. It was expected to fall by the same amount, which would have marked two consecutive quarters in the red following the 0.2 percent drop in the prior period.$$$$The move higher was conspicuously lackluster. The bellwether EUR/USD exchange rate poked back above the 1.10 figure but seems to be struggling for follow-through. In fact, the move is barely challenging the bounds of even the very near-term downtrend traced out since the beginning of the week. That probably reflects the outcome’s limited implications for ECB monetary policy.$$$$15min EURUSD chart created with TradingView.$$$$The central bank topped up an already ultra-accommodative policy stance featuring negative lending rates and TLTRO bank liquidity injections with an open-ended QE effort earlier in the year. Incoming economic data has chronically undershot baseline forecasts for two years, priced-in inflation expectations have been sinking since early 2018 and geopolitics – from trade tensions with the US to Brexit – are not helpful.$$$$On balance, that means the newly-installed ECB President Christine Lagarde and company are unlikely to sing anything but a dovish tune for the time being, German growth notwithstanding. The markets are not pricing in another interest rate cut until late 2020, but that may well be revised to the Euro’s detriment as Eurozone financial conditions approach the tightest in two years despite generous stimulus.$$$$Sizing up overall positioning, prices are testing support in the 1.0968-90 area after seemingly resume the dominant downtrend with a break below a counter-trend line establishing the upswing from October’s swing low. A daily close below that exposes that very bottom at 1.0879. Near-term resistance is in the 1.1069-76 zone, followed by the double top just below the 1.12 figure.$$$$Daily EURUSD chart created with TradingView.$$$$--- Written by Ilya Spivak, Currency Strategist for DailyFX.com.$$$$To contact Ilya, use the comments section below or @IlyaSpivak on Twitter.
EUR/USD Price Remains Under Pressure and Searches for Support	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/11/14/EURUSD-Price-Remains-Under-Pressure-and-Searches-for-Support-.html	1573722000	German Q3 GDP beats expectations but outlook remains weak.$$$$EUR/USD still looking to move lower.	Brand New Q4 2019 USD and EUR Forecast and Top Trading Opportunities.$$$$The most widely traded currency pair in the world, EUR/USD, continues its long drift lower with little in the way of strong support levels to brake its move. Recently announced Q3 German GDP showed the Eurozone’s largest member miss entering technical recession, but overall growth remains tepid. The German economy grew by 0.1% in the third quarter, beating estimations of a 0.1% contraction, but the Q2 reading was downgraded to -0.2% from -0.1%, meaning the economy contracted by 0.1% over the last six months. On an annual basis the German economy grew by 0.5% from July to September. $$$$The EUR/USD daily chart shows the ongoing weakness in the pair with the pair losing around 160 ticks over the last 10 trading sessions. Earlier in the month we identified the 200-day moving average as tough resistance for the pair to break – which it proved – and any support from the 50- and 20-day moving averages proved fleeting.$$$$EUR/USD Price Technical Outlook – Further Upside Remains Blocked.$$$$The pair now look to move further lower with the 1.1000 ‘big figure’ support now longer relevant. EUR/USD is oversold according to the CCI indicator, but this may well just slow down the move and not change its direction. A double low at 1.0940 may stem losses before a re-test of 1.0926 and the October 1 multi-month low at 1.0879. While these targets remain near and achievable, the move may take two or three weeks to play out with the Average True Range of the pair sliding to multi-month lows. Currently around 37 pips, this range is less than half of the range seen at the start of the year and a third of the trading range seen in early 2018.$$$$IG Client Sentiment shows that traders are 62% net-long EURUSD, a bearish contrarian bias.$$$$Traders may be interested in two of our trading guides – Traits of Successful Traders and Top Trading Lessons – while technical analysts are likely to be interested in our latest Elliott Wave Guide.$$$$What is your view on the Euro and the US Dollar – bullish or bearish??

EUR/USD Reverses on Worrying Services PMI, ECB's Lagarde Reiterates Fiscal Easing	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/11/22/EURUSD-Uptick-Faded-on-Mixed-PMI-ECBs-Lagarde-Reiterates-Fiscal-Easing.html	1574413500	Manufacturing Sector Beginning to Stabilise.$$$$Brief Uptick in Euro Faded as Service Sector Convergence Provides Concern.$$$$ECB Chief Lagarde Reiterates Calls for Fiscal Easing.	EUR/USD Price Analysis & News.$$$$BOTTOM LINE $$$$A rather mixed set of PMI figures from both France and Germany, which in turn saw a brief pick up in the Euro quickly faded. The manufacturing sector is starting to show modest signs of stability with both countries reporting better than expected figures, however, Germany remains firmly in contraction territory. The services sector had disappointed with France unmoved at 52.9, while Germany’s services sector dipped to 51.3 from 51.6, marking the slowest growth rate in over 3-years, which in turn saw only a marginal lift in the composite figure. Perhaps more worryingly for Germany is the steady convergence between the weak manufacturing sector and the domestically focused services sector with IHS Markit noting that the lack of employment growth is becoming a concern. $$$$Ultimately, this is unlikely to significantly alter the outlook for the ECB who have continued to maintain the view that fiscal stimulus is needed from those who have capacity in order to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy. This had been aired by the new ECB President, Lagarde, this morning who stated that “monetary policy could achieve its goal faster and with fewer side effects if other policies were supporting growth alongside it”. $$$$Euro-Area Economic Activity Remains Subdued.$$$$EUR/USD Price Chart: 1-Minute Time Frame (Intra-day)$$$$Source: IG Charts.$$$$--- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst.$$$$To contact Justin, email him at Justin.mcqueen@ig.com.$$$$Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX.

Brand New Q4 2019 USD and EUR Forecast and Top Trading Opportunities.$$$$The daily EUR/USD chart is showing a few conflicting signals of late, leaving a decisive break unlikely in the near-term. While the rally off the October 1 multi-month low at 1.0879 looks well supported, the pair are starting to run into resistance which should stem further upside. The pair however are benefitting from one technical indicator which may well limit any notable downside.$$$$EUR/USD made a confirmed break above the 50-day moving average (blue line on chart) at the start of this week, for the first time since mid-July. The 50-dma has capped the pair for most of the year, while the 200-dma has acted as even firmer resistance aside from a breakout between June 21 and July 1. The 50-dma now turns to support for EUR/USD, while the 200-dma is the next important upside target.$$$$The recent rally has broken a series of lower highs, confirming the shift in momentum, and a close above the 1.1250 lower high made on August 6 would change the medium-term outlook for the Euro to positive. A cautionary signal from the CCI indicator which shows that EUR/USD is currently heavily overbought.$$$$Looking ahead the economic calendar has some important data releases next week including Eurozone consumer confidence, German and Eurozone PMIs and German IFO numbers. Of more importance will be the latest ECB monetary policy meeting and press conference on Thursday – President Mario Draghi’s last meeting – and the EU Commission Economic Forecasts on Friday, both notable market moving events.

Boris Johnson needs to secure 320 vote majority to get his deal through parliament and as it stands, it looks to be somewhat neck and neck. Whatever the outcome, GBP/USD is expected to see a sizeable reaction at Sunday’s open with option markets implying a 1.7% move.$$$$US Dollar is on course for its 3rd consecutive weekly dropsignalling a more consistent deterioration in USD sentiment. Fed speakers will provide their final remarks before the blackout period ahead of the October rate decision. As it stands, in light of the weakness in domestic data, the Fed is seen delivering another rate cut.$$$$New Zealand Dollar trades at a 1-month high amid the improved risk tone. As we had highlighted in the CFTC report in recent weeks, given that net shorts in the Kiwi had been at extreme levels, risks were asymmetrically tilted to the upside, particularly with money markets fully priced in for another RBNZ rate cut. That said, the Q3 CPI report, which rose faster than the central banks assumptions has seen 3bps worth of easing priced out, thus keeping the NZD firm.$$$$Source: DailyFX, Refinitiv.$$$$Economic Calendar (18/10/19)$$$$Source: DailyFX,$$$$WHAT’S DRIVING MARKETS TODAY.$$$$--- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst.$$$$To contact Justin, email him at Justin.mcqueen@ig.com.$$$$Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX.$$$$https://www.dailyfx.com/free_guide-tg.html?ref-author=McQueen.

The pair now trade at lows last seen in May 2017 and if the ‘big figure’ support at 1.0900 breaks shortly, then expect prices to drift lower.

Q3 2019 EUR and USD Forecasts and Top Trading Opportunities.$$$$The German economy is likely to fall into recession in the third-quarter of 2019, ‘as the downturn in manufacturing deepened and service sector growth lost momentum’, according to data provider IHS Markit. The composite index hit its lowest level since October 2012, while the manufacturing numbers are ‘simply awful’ according to the data provider. Germany is expected to enter an official recession in Q3 and may not see any growth this year.$$$$According to Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, “The manufacturing numbers are simply awful. All the uncertainty around trade wars, the outlook for the car industry and Brexit are paralyzing order books, with September seeing the worst performance from the sector since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. “With job creation across Germany stalling, the domestic-oriented service sector has lost one of its main pillars of growth. A first fall in services new business for over four-and-a-half years provides evidence that demand across Germany is already starting to deteriorate.”$$$$EURUSD continues to point lower and may re-test the two recent low prints around 1.0925 made earlier this month. Below here there is very little in the way of strong support. There is a gap in April 2017 on the weekly chart between 1.0777 and 1.0821 which is likely to be filled in the short-term, before the January 2017 low at 1.0340 comes into play.

EURUSD is trading back below 1.1000 and at its weakest reading since the September ECB meeting after the latest Eurozone PMI report reignited Euro selling pressure. The flash Eurozone PMI composite output index plunged to a 75-month low in September according to IHS Markit driven by a deepening contraction in the manufacturing industry and is showing signs of spreading to the services sector. The DailyFX Economic Calendar summarizes the data readings and consensus estimates.  $$$$EURUSD took a nosedive below the 1.1000 handle immediately after the Eurozone PMI data figures crossed the wire, which followed Germany’s “simply awful” manufacturing PMI prints. EUR weakness owing to the disappointing datapoints was broad as EURGBP, EURJPY, EURAUD and EURCAD sank similarly, but the Euro has since attempted to rebound from intraday lows while ECB President Mario Draghi’s testimony to the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs unfolds. $$$$ECB’s Draghi is under fire at the European Parliament in Brussels today as the Eurozone’s head central banker discusses its recent monetary policy decisions and outlook on the economy. Here are some highlights from his key comments:$$$$Mario Draghi is not the only central banker in the spotlight Monday as the US comes online. Outgoing Chief of the IMF Christine Lagarde, who will replace Draghi at the ECB’s helm on November 1, just stated in an interview on CNBC that tariffs stemming from the ongoing US-China trade war stand to shave a near full percentage point off global GDP growth next year. Lagarde’s comments follow the recent slash to the OECD’s global GDP growth forecast from 3.2% to 2.9% for 2019 and from 3.4% to 3.0% for 2020 respectively, with the organization’s chief economist underscoring how “growth is taking a dangerous downward turn.” $$$$While EURUSD whipsawed back higher after details out of the September ECB meeting revealed that French, German and Dutch ECB Governors opposed the resumption of quantitative easing, a looming economic recession hinted at by today’s PMI data - coupled with pessimistic comments from Lagarde - may warrant further dovish action from the ECB down the road, which may serve as a daunting headwind for the Euro over the near term. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

While there has been no official reason put forward for her resignation, Lautenschlaeger has previously questioned the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policy and the latest round of quantitative easing recently announced by ECB President Mario Draghi may have been the straw that broke the camel’s back. Lautenschlaeger is the third German ECB board member to have resigned in the last decade after Axel Weber and Jurgen Stark left the central bank in 2011.

EUR/USD Price Analysis and Talking Points:$$$$EUR/USD Fails to Spike Higher $$$$Unlike the Pound, the recent gains in the Euro against the US Dollar have more or less been a grind higher as key resistance curbs any sharp appreciation in the pair. Increased optimism that the UK and EU could potentially reach an agreement before October 31st has seen EUR/USD break out of its 4-month downtrend. However, failure to make a break above the September peak at 1.1109 suggests that this recovery in the Euro is a minor correction as opposed to a meaningful reversal. Therefore, an absence of a deal between the UK and EU before the end of the month could see the Euro maintain its broader downtrend. $$$$ZEW Survey Set for Another Drop.$$$$On the economic calendar, the latest ZEW Survey will be released in which consensus is for another drop. Throughout September, investor angst had been lifted on the repo rate spike, while weak global PMI data had also heightened recession fears. Consequently, a weaker than expected ZEW Survey is likely to keep the Euro modestly under pressure. $$$$EUR/USD Price Chart: Daily Time Frame (Jan 19 – Oct 19)$$$$Resistance 1: 1.1040-45 (23.6% Fib & 50DMA)$$$$Resistance 2: 1.1062 (Last week’s high)$$$$Resistance 3: 1.1109 (September peak)$$$$Support 1: 1.1000 (Psychological)$$$$Support 2: 1.0950.$$$$Support 3: 1.0925 (Sep 3rd & 12th bottom) $$$$FX TRADING RESOURCES:$$$$--- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst.$$$$To contact Justin, email him at Justin.mcqueen@ig.com.$$$$Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX.

Brand New Q4 2019 USD and EUR Forecast and Top Trading Opportunities.$$$$A lack of any positive drivers has left EUR/USD lethargic this week with traders looking at other currency pairs for trading opportunities. The pair have moved slightly higher due to the current weakness in the US dollar, but the drift higher has been tempered by the lack of any positive economic news or data out of the Eurozone. Eurozone industrial production y/y fell further in August – to -2.8% from -2.0% in July – while Eurozone ZEW sentiment surveys for October remained heavily in negative territory and below September’s levels. There is little Eurozone hard data for the rest of the week. The single-currency may benefit if a Brexit deal is finally agreed, yet all the positive talk surrounding the negotiations has so far failed to bring a deal that both sides are willing to, and can, sign off.$$$$DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$The daily chart shows EUR/USD currently finding short-term support from the 50-day moving average for the first time in three months, although the pattern of lower highs and lower lows off the June 25 high remains in place.

EUR/USD Price: Resistance Remains Firm Ahead of ECB Meeting, PMIs	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/10/23/EURUSD-Price-Resistance-Remains-Firm-Ahead-of-ECB-Meeting-PMIs.html	1571817600	EUR/USD rangebound as ECB nears.$$$$Will ECB’s Draghi continue his call for fiscal expansion?	Brand New Q4 2019 USD and EUR Forecast and Top Trading Opportunities.$$$$The 200-day moving average has proved to be the thorn in the EUR/USD bull’s side over the last year, acting as strong resistance to further upside. The only break above the 200-dma in late June/early July was quickly reversed and led to further falls. It is likely to remain the case in the short-term that EUR/USD will remain weak and test support at 1.1107 ahead of 1.1100 and the 1.1065 area, leaving the recent uptrend under pressure.$$$$EUR/USD Price: Short-Term Rally May Run Into Resistance.$$$$Thursday’s ECB meeting will be President Mario Draghi’s last and while no policy levers or settings are expected to be touched, he may well reiterate his call for a round of fiscal stimulus within the Eurozone. President Draghi has injected around EUR2.5 trillion into the Eurozone’s economy via various bouts of quantitative easing, expanding the central bank’s balance sheet to over EUR4.65 trillion, and recently announced another round to try and boost price pressures in the single block. In recent weeks, President Draghi has called for countries within the Eurozone to help boost growth and inflation via new fiscal stimulus measures. $$$$Ahead of the ECB meeting, the latest batch of French, German and Eurozone PMIs will be released with little, or no, improvement expected from the current lowly levels. The important manufacturing sector remains weak with the German reading in September the lowest since mid-2009, while the Eurozone number pointed to the steepest contraction in the sector since October 2012.$$$$DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$IG Client Sentiment shows that traders are 61% net-short EURUSD, a bullish contrarian bias.$$$$However recent daily and weekly positional changes give us a mixed outlook for EUR/USD.$$$$Traders may be interested in two of our trading guides – Traits of Successful Traders and Top Trading Lessons – while technical analysts are likely to be interested in our latest Elliott Wave Guide.$$$$What is your view on the Euro and the US Dollar – bullish or bearish??

US Dollar Price Outlook: EUR/USD Eyes GDP, Trade Balance Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/08/28/us-dollar-price-outlook-eur-to-usd-eyes-gdp-trade-balance-data.html	1567018080	The US Dollar could drop if Q2 US GDP report revisions paint a gloomier picture of the US economy which may accelerate Fed rate cut bets.$$$$USD currency pairs may also be at risk with the July advanced goods trade balance data set for release seeing that it could spark an adverse reaction from US President Trump.$$$$New to forex trading? Check out this free Forex for Beginners educational guide.	The US Dollar could be at risk in light of upcoming economic data releases slated for Thursday’s trading session. EURUSD implied volatility is subdued ahead of Thursday’s high-impact event risk listed on the DailyFX Economic Calendar, but the world’s most liquid currency pair has potential to react sharply to Euro-area economic data early on.$$$$Germany – the EU’s largest economy – is already on the brink of falling into a recession and upcoming datapoints on inflation and the labor market that fail to inspire confidence stand to weigh in on the market’s expectations for the ECB to provide an aggressive stimulus package.$$$$That is not to say that spot EURUSD will lack a response to updated Q2 US GDP data or the release of the latest US Advance Goods Trade Balance figures. Q2 US GDP data is expected to be revised downward by 0.1% from the initial 2.1% annualized reading according to Bloomberg’s median estimate. Aside from the headline gross domestic product figure, market participants will likely scrutinize the sub-components for signs of relative strength or weakness across America’s economy. Attention could be focused on the positive contributions to Q2 US GDP growth including personal consumption expenditures and government outlays which were partly offset by falling net exports, inventories, and fixed investment. $$$$Furthermore, a sharper than previously reported decline in fixed investment – likely owing to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the US-China trade war – could pressure the US Dollar as it has potential to accelerate the market’s expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.Also, the outstanding risk posed by a potential tweet from US President Trump in reaction to the closely watched economic data could sink the US Dollar as well. $$$$July’s advance goods trade balance data could also serve as a catalyst that motivates Trump to bash the Federal Reserve and strong US Dollar. Although the US trade deficit improved slightly in June, the monthly figure still stands at roughly -$74 billion and is notably lower than when President Trump took office in 2017. As such, the US Dollar could be dragged lower if signs of a growing deficit and/or lower exports are revealed in tomorrow’s advance goods trade balance report. This is because it will likely increase the market’s Fed rate cut bets while also encouraging President Trump to reaccelerate the US-China trade war. $$$$That said, spot USDCNH may provide the cleanest depiction of downside risk faced by the greenback relative to other major US Dollar currency pairs. We previously brought to light how the Chinese Yuan could serve as a US-China trade war barometer with gains in spot USDCNH indicating tensions remain elevated and may even escalate further. While this may initially spark safe haven demand and send forex traders flocking to the US Dollar, price action could get strong-armed lower as the market reassess the likelihood of further Fed rate cuts. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.
US Dollar Price Outlook: Is the USD Rally Becoming Stretched?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/08/20/US-Dollar-Price-Outlook-Is-the-USD-Rally-Becoming-Stretched.html	1566294840	US President Trump wants interest rate cuts and lots of them. $$$$The strength of the USD continues to annoy the US President.	Q3 2019 USD Forecast andTop Trading Opportunities.$$$$Another 0.25% US interest cut is fully priced-in for the September FOMC meeting with markets also seeing a 16% chance of a 0.50% rate cut as the central bank gets set to loosen monetary policy further as recession fears grow. US President Donald Trump is looking for 100 basis points of rate cuts, according to his Twitter account, as he continues to state that the US dollar is too high and uncompetitive against the other majors.$$$$Yet the greenback refuses to wilt and move lower with the daily US dollar chart dominated by an unbroken trend of higher lows from late-June onwards, sending the price back to challenge its recent 98.47 high, the highest level seen since mid-May 2017. The dollar is also above all three supportive moving averages. The CCI indictor shows the USD nearing overbought territory, although its recent rise is slowing down. $$$$The dollar is picking up a bid from a weak Euro and Brexit-weakened British Pound, but its recent rally may be setting up the market for a ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact’ moment that could see the supportive uptrend, currently around 97.28, tested in the short-term.$$$$Currency Volatility: Euro Potentially Under-Pricing Italian Risk.$$$$GBPUSD Price Outlook Fragile as Boris Johnson Heads to Europe.$$$$Ahead this week, the FOMC minutes on Wednesday will be closely parsed for any signs that the Fed are considering further easing, while Fed chair Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday may well add further color on the central bank’s stance. $$$$Keep up to date with all key economic data and event releases via the DailyFX Economic Calendar.$$$$US Dollar Price Outlook: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD and USD/CAD.$$$$Traders may be interested in two of our trading guides – Traits of Successful Traders and Top Trading Lessons – while technical analysts are likely to be interested in our latest Elliott Wave Guide.$$$$What is your view on USD – bullish or bearish?

According to Harker, ‘the risk remains, therefore, that the euro area’s largest economy will have fallen into technical recession in the third quarter’. $$$$EURUSD hardly moved post-release and continues to trade either side of 1.1100 with little inclination to make a sustained break. Traders will likely be waiting for Friday’s speech by Fed chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium, after last night’s FOMC minutes provided little in the way of guidance.

Euro Rate Outlook: PMI Data Eyed by EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/08/21/euro-rate-outlook-eurozone-pmi-data-eyed-by-eurusd-eurgbp-eurjpy-eurcad.html	1566423000	Euro price action will likely turn to August Eurozone PMI numbers from Markit on Thursday as forex traders weigh their potential impact on future ECB monetary policy decisions $$$$EURUSD, EURGBP, EURJPY, EURAUD and EURCAD overnight implied volatility measures all tick higher ahead of the Eurozone PMI and consumer confidence data dump $$$$Fiending for volatility? Check out this article on How to Trade the Most Volatile Currency Pairs.	While markets speculate over possible dovish remarks from global central bankers at the highly-anticipated Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, forex traders will be provided with hard economic data which could set the tone for monetary policy expectations. Turning to the DailyFX Economic Calendar, we find that Thursday’s data dump out of the EU will kick off with Markit releasing August PMI numbers on France at 7:15 GMT followed by Germany PMI readings at 7:30 GMT. $$$$Also, the headline composite Eurozone PMI figure, which keeps edging closer toward contraction territory (a reading below 50.0), is slated to cross wires at 8:30 GMT. July ECB minutes and the Eurozone consumer confidence report for August will be published during Thursday’s trading session as well which are expected at 11:30 GMT and 14:00 GMT respectively. $$$$A sharp deterioration across the Euro economy – most recently evidenced by plunging ZEW sentiment readings and Germany’s GDP contracting by -0.1% in Q2 – has steered Citi’s Eurozone Economic Surprise Index to its lowest level since March. In turn, calls for the European Central Bank (ECB) to step up its stimulus efforts have grown louder and has kept the Euro under pressure as dovish ECB bets rise.$$$$Consequently, currency price action across EUR pairs could heat up in the event August Eurozone PMI data catches the market off-guard with better (or worse) than expected economic readings. The July ECB minutes also have potential to swing the Euro – particularly if details on forthcoming monetary policy accommodation measures are revealed. As such, it should come as no surprise that overnight implied volatility measures for EURUSD, EURJPY, EURGBP, EURAUD and EURCAD all ticked higher ahead of Thursday trade. $$$$EURUSD overnight implied volatility increased from 4.22% on Tuesday to 5.30% to day but remains slightly below its average of 5.99% over the last 12-months. EURGBP, largely watched by forex traders to gauge the latest Brexit developments, is expected to be the most volatile Euro currency pair with an overnight implied volatility reading of 9.43%. Also, EURJPY overnight implied volatility of 7.83% could be priced a bit low by forex option traders in light of Japan’s consumer price index release due Thursday as well. $$$$Despite the closely watched Eurozone PMI data having serious potential to move the market’s needle, spot EURUSD could have a limited reaction to Thursday’s economic indicators considering the currency pair will largely by driven by Jackson Hole and US Dollar Price Action. That said, spot EURUSD has potential to eclipse the 1.1100 price level again even if Eurozone PMI data disappoints with the prospect of a dovish Fed looming. EURUSD upside could run out of steam prior to hitting the ceiling of the option-implied trading range, however, if technical resistance from the 8-day EMA or 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level come into play.$$$$EURJPY price action in response to Thursday’s Eurozone PMI data could be a better measure of the market’s and Euro’s reaction. The Euro likely stands to sink against the sentiment-driven Japanese Yen if the PMI data fails to inspire risk taking and prompts a move toward safe-havens. In this scenario, EURJPY bears could push for a retest of August’s lows slightly above the 117.50 handle. Conversely, EURJPY upside might be limited by the 23.6% Fib around 119.00 in addition to the currency pair’s 20-day SMA as well as its option-implied upper barrier of 118.61. $$$$EURGBP price action remains largely dominated by Brexit drama, but further deterioration in EU fundamentals potentially revealed by Thursday’s PMI data release could cause forex traders to focus less on Brexit and more on forthcoming ECB stimulus. On the contrary, upbeat PMI readings out of the Eurozone could keep spot EURGBP fixated on Brexit. That said, if EURGBP drifts below technical confluence stemming from the 23.6% Fib of the pair’s steep climb since May, it could open up the door for Euro to give back some more of its gains as bullish momentum wanes.$$$$Albeit a less popular currency pair, EURCAD appears to be gearing up for a breakout and may very well be worth putting on the watchlist. We recently pointed to the Canadian Dollar strengthening in response to hotter-than-expected CPI data published early Wednesday, which is a trend that has potential of continuing if Eurozone economic readings disappoint and strongarm price action lower – particularly if spot prices fail to catch bid around the bullish trendline or EURCAD sinks below confluent support from the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the currency pair’s trading range since 2017. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.
EURUSD Price Struggles to Move as US Labor Report (NFP) Looms	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/09/06/EURUSD-Struggles-to-Move-as-US-Labor-Report-NFP-Looms.html	1567767600	US NFP will be the short-term driver of EURUSD price action.$$$$ECB and FOMC rate decisions will steer EURUSD over the medium-term 	Q3 2019 EUR and USD Forecasts and Top Trading Opportunities.$$$$The latest US Labor report, scheduled at 12.30 GMT, is expected to show job growth of 160k in August after growth of 164k in July. The unemployment rate is expected unchanged at 3.7%, while average hourly earnings y/y are seen turning 0.2% lower to 3.0%. The market started to price-in better than expected job growth on Thursday after ADP employment change beat expectations – 195k against 148k. While the two numbers are not strongly correlated, the US job market remains robust and an upside beat today cannot be ruled out. $$$$Live Coverage of the US Labor Report from 12.15 GMT - Webinar.$$$$IG Client Sentiment data show that of retail traders are 61.0% net-long of EURUSD, a bearish contrarian indicator. However, recent daily and weekly positional changes suggest that EURUSD may soon reverse higher.$$$$While today’s NFP report will decide the short-term future of EURUSD, over the coming two weeks there will be important central bank rate decisions from the ECB and the Fed that will have a longer-term impact on the pair. The ECB meeting on Thursday September 12 is expected to see the central bank cut the deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.50%, introduce a tiered bank rate and either announce or implement a fresh round of bond buying (QE) to re-boot the Euro-Zone economy. Lower interest rates and renewed QE will weigh on the Euro further.$$$$And less than one week later – September 18 – the US Federal Reserve are fully expected to cut the Fed fund rate by another 0.25% to 1.75% to 2.0%, the second cut this year. There is a very small chance that the Fed may cut by 50 basis points – something that would please a vocal US President Trump – although a strong NFP number today may take that possibility off the table. This meeting will also see the release of the latest US economic projections which should give the market greater insight into the Fed’s thinking and the current state of the US economy. $$$$Traders may be interested in two of our trading guides – Traits of Successful Traders and Top Trading Lessons – while technical analysts are likely to be interested in our latest Elliott Wave Guide.$$$$What is your view on EURUSD – bullish or bearish??

Our weekly US Dollar Technical Outlook succumbed to fundamental headwinds stemming from uninspiring data prints on America’s economy. Lackluster US Dollar price action throughout the week can also be largely attributed to spot GBPUSD surging on upbeat Brexit developments as well as a rebound in spot EURUSD driven by commentary from ECB officials. EURUSD and GBPUSD respectfully comprise 57.6% and 11.9% of the DXY Index – a popular basket of USD currency pairs. $$$$Chart created by @RichDvorakFX with TradingView.$$$$Looking ahead, the DXY US Dollar Index still has potential to forge a bullish reversal back toward its highest level since May 2017 from a technical perspective, which we pointed out in Thursday’s US Dollar volatility report. USD price action has so far found support from its upward sloping 20-day simple moving average slightly above the 98.00 handle. This area of technical confluence is highlighted by the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the US Dollar’s steady ascent from its June 25 low to September 03 high. $$$$If selling pressure continues throughout next week, however, the DXY Index may look to its 50-day simple moving average which rests around the mid-point of its aforementioned bullish leg. Aside from US Dollar technicals, it is worth noting the sizable impact that Wednesday’s European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate decision stands to have on the DXY Index considering the basket is weighted heavy to EURUSD. Also, a slew of economic indicators will be released on the US economy which have potential to weigh on rate traders’ expectations for additional monetary policy accommodation from the Federal Reserve. $$$$While the US Dollar forex economic calendar is jam-packed with data releases scheduled for next week, markets will likely place more credence on the US consumer price index (CPI) report set to cross the wires Thursday at 12:30 GMT. Although US retail sales and consumer sentiment present high-impact event risk and may spark US Dollar price action, the Federal Reserve stands to place heavier weight on inflation readings seeing that price stability is one of the central bank’s stated dual mandates. As such, the August CPI report is anticipated to overshadow Fed monetary policy expectations. $$$$As previously mentioned, the September ECB meeting will more likely than not impact the US Dollar and DXY Index. In light of major event risk surrounding a central bank interest rate decision and updated monetary policy outlook, it is to be expected that implied volatility should tick higher as uncertainty builds and speculation swirls around what might actually unfold. That said, EURUSD 1-week implied volatility of 6.33% fits our assumption considering it is above the 20-day average reading of 5.14% and falls in the top 60th percentile over the last 12-months. $$$$On the opposite side of the spectrum, US Dollar implied volatility for the week ahead is considerably muted for USDCAD and AUDUSD. This could be attributed to the September BOC meeting now in the rearview mirror and positive US-China trade war developments crushing volatility measures more broadly. $$$$On another note, the latest IG Client Sentiment data on spot EURUSD indicates that 60.9% of retail traders are net-long resulting in a long-to-short ratio of 1.56 to 1. Also, the number of traders net-long is 18.1% lower while the number of traders net-shorts is 45.4% higher compared to last week’s figures. Although we typically hold a contrarian view on crowd sentiment, the recent changes in client positioning suggests that spot EURUSD may soon reverse higher despite traders remain net-long. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

The US Dollar climbed to a multi-year high at the start of this month as the world’s reserve currency strengthened against its major counterparts as global growth worries and trade tensions rile investors. The Dollar slid overnight in a continuation from the ECB rate decision where ECB head Draghi announced a restart to Europe’s Quantitative easing programwhich saw EURUSD whipsaw before treading higher. Investors now look toward next week’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision where a 25-basis point rate cut is largely expected with overnight swaps pricing a 98.1% chance of a quarter point cut. $$$$After the overnight pullback in the aftermath of the ECB rate decision, the Dollar is now lifting modestly on upbeat US economic data, although the Greenback is still below pre-ECB levels and remains under pressure, the DXY Index is currently sitting at 98.23 in Friday morning trading. Advance US Retail sales rose 0.4% for August as US Consumers increased their purchases of autos. Business inventories also rose 0.4% for the month of July after coming in flat for June. Business inventories are a key component in calculating US GDP growth. $$$$Another key market focus along with the Federal Reserve and other Central Banks is the US-China trade war which seems to hit a standstill as China buys US AG products and considers excluding national security matters from negotiations. The concerns around trade tensions were highlighted in this morning’s consumer sentiment report out of the University of Michigan. Although the headline figure beat with a reading of 92.0, concern about trade wars intensified with the report stating “concerns about the impact of tariffs on the domestic economy also rose in early September, with 38% of all consumers making spontaneous references to the negative impact of tariffs, the highest percentage since March 2018.”$$$$Trade war tensions now seem to be a persistent theme in the world economic landscape as the Federal Reserve now weighs it as a major headwind to future global growth. Chairman Powell highlighted the impacts on financial markets from these risks in his keynote speech last month in Jackson Hole, along with geopolitical risks from a hard Brexit and rising tensions in Hong Kong. Markets now await next weeks FOMC decision with both overnight swaps and the CME Group’s FedWatch tool largely pricing a cut. $$$$--Written by Thomas Westwater, Intern Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow Thomas on Twitter @FxWestwater.$$$$DailyFX forecasts on a variety of currencies such as the US Dollar or the Euro are available from the DailyFX Trading Guides page.

EUR/USD Price Action Eyes Inflation Data Ahead of Fed	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/29/eur-usd-price-action-eyes-inflation-data-ahead-of-fed.html	1564428960	 Spot EURUSD currency traders shift focus to Tuesday’s release of Eurozone and US inflation numbers in addition to US Consumer Confidence  $$$$ EURUSD implied volatility appears low and indicates attention remains fixated on the upcoming July Fed meeting $$$$ Find out how IG Client Sentiment can be used to identify the bullish and bearish biases of forex traders and reveal potential forex trading opportunities 	 The EURUSD Forex Economic Calendar is stacked for Tuesday’s trading session with high-impact data slated to cross the wires out of the Eurozone and US. Updated readings on GDP, inflation and consumer confidence are expected, which all have potential to spark volatility in spot EURUSD.  $$$$ Despite the several economic indicators due for release that typically move the market’s needle, Tuesday’s data dump out of the Eurozone and US is anticipated to be broadly overlooked by forex traders judging by EURUSD implied volatility. $$$$ EURUSD overnight implied volatility was just clocked at 4.85% and is noticeably below the 12-month average of 6.10%. The subdued reading for EURUSD overnight implied volatility suggests that Eurozone CPI and US Core PCE inflation data is chalked up to be non-events. As such, there may be little reaction or follow through in spot EURUSD. This can be explained principally by the looming July Fed meeting scheduled for the following day which is expected to be the dominant market theme this week.  $$$$ Interestingly, the demand for spot EURUSD downside protection is quickly returning as suggested by. This could be explained by the fact that US economic data has come in hotter-than-expected as of late, whereas Eurozone economic data has broadly disappointed to the downside, according to recent Citi Economic Surprise Index readings.  $$$$ That said, spot EURUSD is estimated to fluctuate within a 56-pip range between 1.1112-1.1168 during Tuesday’s trading session with a 68% statistical probability calculated from EURUSD overnight implied volatility of 4.85%. Moves to the downside may prove short lived considering major technical support at the 1.1100 mark in addition to the outstanding risk that the Fed shocks markets with a firm monetary policy stance on Wednesday. $$$$ Yet, there is the possibility that EURUSD overnight implied volatility is underpriced and the upcoming Eurozone and US economic data will spark a larger-than-expected move in the spot market. If Eurozone inflation data comes in below market consensus, the need for future monetary stimulus hinted at by ECB President Draghi last week could be solidified and would likely send spot EURUSD lower. Then again, a move lower may be reversed if US inflation and consumer confidence data disappoint as well seeing that it could encourage greater expectations for an aggressive Fed rate cut later this week.  $$$$ -- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com $$$$ Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight 
Stock Market Outlook: Top 3 Themes to Watch in AAPL Earnings	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/29/Stock-Market-Outlook-Top-3-Themes-to-Watch-in-AAPL-Earnings.html	1564432500	 AAPL is one of the world’s largest publicly traded companies and is viewed as a stock market bellwether by some – affording the company significant sway over equity sentiment $$$$ Trade war headwinds or concerns likely carry the largest implications for the broader market, while stock-specific themes may damage AAPL shares directly  $$$$ Interested in other stock market insight? Sign up for the Weekly Equity Webinar. 	 AAPL stock traded higher on Monday, likely in anticipation of quarterly results due Tuesday. The tech-giant currently stands as the second largest publicly traded company by market capitalization and some stock traders look to the corporation as a bellwether for the larger equity market. Consequently, Apple’s earnings report can carry significant implications for the entire equity market and have even sparked a currency flash crash. That said, there are various themes to watch, ranging from trade war concerns to sector-specific headwinds. Here are the three most important.  $$$$ The first, and likely most important theme to be cognizant of, is commentary on the ongoing US-China trade war. Any indication that the trade spat has weighed, or will weigh, on earnings more than originally anticipated will likely rattle both Apple and broad-market investors alike. Given the company’s brand loyalty, size and robust cash reserves, it is widely believed Apple is well suited to withstand transitory threats. With that in mind, Apple shares may grapple with any negative development comparatively well while the broader market – comprised of company’s that do not enjoy the same attributes as Apple – may suffer the consequences. The broader equity implications this theme can carry make it the most important on the list. $$$$ Last week, Apple announced a $1 billion acquisition of Intel’s (INTC) smartphone modem business. The deal was inked to further progress Apple’s 5G technology for iPhones, but also carries consequences for another member of the tech sector – Qualcomm (QCOM). While the technology is still far from launch, the enhanced in-house capability for Apple will eventually allow Apple to avoid royalty payments to Qualcomm that total around $2 billion a year according to Bloomberg.  $$$$ Interested in longer-term trades? Check out our Third Quarter Forecasts for Gold, EURUSD, the Dow Jones and more. $$$$ While the acquisition does not have an immediate impact for the parties involved, it may weigh on QCOM earnings in the future while allowing Apple to provide stable pricing. Therefore, what investors should look for in the earnings call on Tuesday is any commentary regarding the timeline and corresponding cost-cutting or revenue forecasts from the freshly-signed deal. This is likely to have the least impact on the broader-market, but could directly influence AAPL, INTC and QCOM.  $$$$ Finally, Apple investors await answers on the progress of the corporation’s services arm. Under CEO Tim Cook, the iPhone-maker has pursued an expansion of paid-services like Apple Music, iTunes, Apple Pay, and a new credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs. The service business has become an increasingly large, and therefore important, portion of Apple’s total revenue. As iPhone sales continue to plateau, further growth in the services sector will become the most critical aspect of the company’s earnings report. It will also help the California-based company compete with competitors like Microsoft (MSFT) which has already transitioned heavily into providing services versus hardware.  $$$$ While the three themes carry different possibilities for Apple’s share price and potential to impact the broader market, each of them has the ability to spark volatility. That said, a highly anticipated rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday has helped to depress Apple’s implied volatility ahead of earnings.  $$$$ To that end, the implied price-range after earnings is just $17. Despite the relatively acute range, it encompasses one notable point of resistance around $215. The level marks the stock’s swing high on May 1 and could arguably pose as the right brim of a prolonged cup and handle pattern.  $$$$ While the signal’s formation is far from perfect, a cup and handle pattern is typically followed by a bullish breakout when the cup’s brim is surpassed. An encouraging quarterly performance could see fundamentals align with technicals and drive AAPL shares through resistance at $215. Such a development would assist the stock in reclaiming all-time highs around $233.

Download forecasts for these assets and more with technical and fundamental insight from the DailyFX Trading Guides page.  $$$$ There were prominent fundamental developments across the global financial system to start the week and there are more than a few sparks to expect over the immediate trading horizon, but the impact that these events have will be distorted by a single dominant event: the FOMC rate decision. The Fed rate decision on Wednesday carries the attention of the market-at-large owing to unique status as the world's largest central bank and the potential turning point that it finds itself in monetary policy terms. A certainty of a rate cut is reflected in Fed Funds futures and swaps, which has in turn amplified the market's interest exponentially. For the Dollar, the approach of a lower yield hasn't perturbed its course with a 7th consecutive session of climb when looking at an equally-weighted measure that reduces weight to EURUSD. That could very well reflect an FX line of anticipation where the FOMC keeps to its planned measured pace with an insurance ('one-and-done') cut that maintains carry advantage. If that is true, either the Dollar or US equity indices are in for a rude awakening.  $$$$ Chart of Equally-Weighted Dollar Index with Consecutive Candle Count (Daily) $$$$ Chart Created using TradingView Charts $$$$ With such a systemically-influential event ahead of us, it will be difficult to register clear traction in other areas of the market or through other fundamental means - even the same theme of monetary policy from another major policy group. Early Tuesday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is due to update its policy; though it is expected to mark no changes. The maintenance of its extreme loose setting would surprise no one, but the context of the less-than-aggressive dovish drive from the European Central Bank (ECB) and aggressive expectations for the Fed will likely heighten the interest for this particularly extended group. We should start to account more of the global picture of monetary policy and its ability to support aggressive speculation rather than simply gauge the advantage or discount it affords individual currencies relative to each other.  $$$$ Graph of Percieved Monetary Policy of Fed and Other Major Central Banks $$$$ While the primary event this week is the Fed decision Wednesday, we will be hitting on other key themes that have waxed and waned for influence these past weeks. Growth last week was a reflection upon the disparate course differences as of late between the US and rest of world. After the momentum of news from IMF forecast to July PMIs to 2Q US GDP building the appeal of Greenback and Dow, we are now seeing the contrast develop on the other side of the scales. Saturday showed Chinese industrial profits - an important tie in to exports and manufacturing which is key to the country's growth - dropped by 3.1 percent last month, one of the biggest monthly declines since end of 2015. Tuesday, we are due the first of the European GDP readings with France's data due. Other indicators with an economic bent like the United States' own Conference Board Consumer Confidence survey should be accounted for but registered for reasonable market impact and not afforded a Fed decision-like assumption just because anticipation for volatility runs so high.  $$$$ The contrast to the conveniently timed economic releases on tap this week are the lurking threats of a sudden flare up in trade wars. There is no clear event, and therefore time frame, for which we can peg a sudden jolt of interest in the fraying economic relationships of the largest countries; but the impact any unexpected developments could have is too enormous to right off just because it is difficult to prepare. President Trump's remarks last week that a compromise with China may not come until after the election has markets tabulating the economic pain into which that would translate. Similarly, the President's warning Friday that the digital tax from France would earn ""substantial reciprocal action on Macron's foolishness shortly"" should have investors on watch for the long-feared spillover of a costly trade war.  $$$$ Chart of USDCNH with USDAUD Overlaid in Red (Daily) $$$$ If we had to assign a title of biggest move through the open of the week, it would no doubt go to the British Pound. If left to the status quo of uncertainty as to our course between a Brexit negotiation impasse between the UK and EU against the backdrop of an October 31st deadline, we would likely have seen the Sterling level out. That may seem counter-intuitive, but the currency has already shed significant value these past months against the risk of uncertainty and the economic pain it is already registering, whether a solution was found eventually or not. However, the stakes were certainly raised over the weekend and into Monday by new Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his cabinet.  $$$$ Chart of GBPUSD with Ratio of 5-Day ATR to 20-Day ATR (Daily) $$$$ On the campaign for leadership of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister, Johnson made clear that he would not shy away from a 'no deal' Brexit if European negotiators would not afford a more favorable deal with the UK. Therefore, his aggressive stance shouldn't be a true surprise. Nevertheless, his remarks that he would not meet EU counterparts unless they agreed to abandon the backstop seems an insurmountable non-starter. To start the trading week, the Sterling has dropped across board with the worst single-day slump on an equally-weighted basis since November 18th and the lowest overall level since September 2017. This has registered as prominent technical breaks for GBPUSD, EURGBP and GBPJPY; while some other pairs like GBPCAD, GBPNZD and GBPAUD has leveled up to long-term support. How far will Johnson push this game of chicken? Lessons from the Dollar and Trump suggest it is wise not to assume the path of least resistance.  $$$$ Chart of Equally-Weighed Pound Index and Daily Rate of Change (Daily) $$$$ Outside of the systemic or compounding fundamental themes, there are more concentrated event risks to consider for some of the other majors in the open market. The Euro is facing an interesting mix of domestic event risk from the French 2Q GDP reading to the Euro-area sentiment surveys in the upcoming session. That said, I'm more convinced that the currency will play the (ironically) more stalwart to a more unsteady Dollar, Pound and Yen. Though economic health leaves much to be desired and the ECB seems on pace for more aggressive easing, don't underestimate the Euro's capacity to offer outlet.  $$$$ Chart of Equally-Weighted Euro Index and 5-Day Momentum (Daily) $$$$ The Japanese Yen is another currency that should be watched closely for its inherent event risk. The Bank of Japan rate decision is unlikely to generate much of a response from the currency - as history has shown a fade in speculative response to the aggressively dovish central bank - but the event serves as the extreme end of the monetary policy curve for the major central banks. That may not lead to a clean move for the likes of the USDJPY, EURJPY or GBPJPY directly; but the underlying implications for risk trends will eventually make it back to the market's core. $$$$ Chart of USDJPY Overlaid with S&P 500 in Red (Daily) $$$$ Two other currencies worth keeping a weary eye on are the Australian Dollar and Swiss Franc. In the former's case, we have a fallen carry currency that has started to shift to the same dovish perspective that has overtaken the global monetary policy mix. With the market already pricing in possibility of an RBA rate cut later in the year, the market will be tuned into Tuesday evening's (Wednesday morning for Sydney) 2Q CPI out of Australia. A weak reading would fit the loss of altitude for the group and likely render the stronger response. Meanwhile, the Swiss Franc is a haven for which the local central bank is attempting to dissuade interest. Reports that the SNB is attempting to intervene on behalf of the Franc renders as much response from the market as it has in the past (which is to say 'little'), but with Donald Trump calling fall more loudly as of late, we should not write off the significance of this effort. $$$$ Chart of AUDCHF (Daily) $$$$ If you want to download my Manic-Crisis calendar, you can find the updated file here.  $$$$ See how retail traders are positioning in EURUSD, GBPUSD and other Dollar-based majors alongsidea host of other liquid FX pairs using the DailyFX speculative positioning data on the sentiment page.

As the US dollar continues to rally on an expected dovish stance from the Fed, EURUSD will see some movement throughout the day as inflation figures will be released for both the dollar and the euro. The pair remained unsettled in the overnight session supported by weaker than expected French Q2 GDP, coming in at 0.2%, below expectations of 0.3%. The pair has been trading near 2-year lows on the back of USD strength which took the dollar index to two-month highs of 97.75.$$$$EURUSD Q3 Forecast.$$$$But the euro regained some strength in the beginning of the morning session as the pair was pushing higher towards the 1.1150 barrier ahead of the latest round of Eurozone confidence data.$$$$Both industrial and services confidence worsened in July leading to a decreased in the overall economic confidence within the Eurozone. Consumer confidence managed to pick up 0.6 points in July to -6.6 after dipping to -7.2 in June, well above its long-term average of -10.7 and moving closer to its highest level of -1.4 registered in May 2000. Economic confidence fell from 103.3 to 102.7 in the month of July, as continued trade wars, Brexit uncertainty and slowing growth keep investor confidence tilted to the downside.$$$$Last week the ECB decided to leave rates unchanged in its July meeting, but it adjusted its forward guidance to reflect the growing need for a rate cut to happen. It mentioned that rates will be kept at current or lower levels until the first half of 2020, hinting that Mario Draghi is prepared to lower rates further into negative territory before he leaves office at the end of October, possibly taking the deposit rate to -0.5% with the likelihood of a tiered margin system to counteract the effects negative rates have on banks’ profitability.

PCE data from the US will see some moves in the pair as a weaker reading will lead to some initial dollar weakness but that may be quickly corrected as lower inflation will further support the need for a rate cut from the Fed in their July meeting to be held tomorrow, which will provide a driver for USD.$$$$Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor.$$$$KEY TRADING RESOURCES:$$$$--- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst.$$$$To contact Daniela, email her at Daniela.Sabin@ig.com.$$$$Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin.

Fed's Powell Shakes the Dow and Dollar as Markets Confused on Next Steps	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/08/01/Feds-Powell-Shakes-the-Dow-and-Dollar-as-Markets-Confused-on-Next-Step.html	1564622100	The Fed cut rates for the first time in over a decade by 25bp to 2.00-2.25% seeming to keep options for more on the table.$$$$Already pricing in multiple cuts in 2019, the market was thrown for a loop when Powell’s rhetoric seemed to waver on whether future cuts are in store.$$$$While risk was clearly fixed on the Fed, there was also considerable activity surrounding growth forecasts, trade wars and Brexit.	FOMC Talking Points: $$$$What do the DailyFX Analysts expect from the Dollar, Euro, Equities, Oil and more through the 3Q 2019? Download forecasts for these assets and more with technical and fundamental insight from the DailyFX Trading Guides page. $$$$The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy update this past session was a rollercoaster for the markets. A pivotal event in the evolution of this major central bank’s influence over the global financial markets, investors were watching closely to see if the US authority would provide another speculative foothold to the collective easing of policy worldwide. The bank would both meet expectations and disappoint in the same effort. The most tangible development from conclusion of the two-day meeting was a 25 basis point (bp) rate cut. That would lower the benchmark range to 2.00 – 2.25 percent as the first move to ease since the end of 2008 when rates essentially bottomed out at zero at the height of the Great Financial Crisis. It would also cap the second longest period between rate cuts in the modern age and set at least an interim peak far lower than what we had seen in previous decades. $$$$Chart of Global Benchmark Rates (Monthly)$$$$The rate cut itself was expected. As seen in Fed Fund futures and overnight swaps – not to mention the lift from US equities – a cut was fully priced in. Therefore, this measure alone not be the determining factor of the market’s evaluation of impact. In fact, there was a non-inconsequential probability of a 50 bp cut at this meeting (approximately 20 percent) that perhaps left the capital markets a little disappointed. That offered the Dollar a little lift and speculative appetite something of a set back. In the statement that accompanied the decision, the Fed remained optimistic on growth and employment trends while offering a relatively modest evaluation of the shortfall in inflation – certainly not enough to suggest an aggressive run of rate cuts was at hand. That said, the language would afford for interpretation that future rate cuts were possible should conditions warrant. So, not exactly a one-and-down. $$$$Chart of DXY Dollar Index and Expected Fed Cuts Through Dec 2019 and Dec 2020 (Daily)$$$$Chart of DXY Dollar Index byTradingView.$$$$The real fireworks came with Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference half an hour after the rate decision. Perhaps realizing that at least half the market would be disappointed regardless of the outcome, the central banker seemed on the defensive and struggled to walk the fine line they aim for in order to achieve a ‘non-event’ in the market’s eyes. He would fall well short of earning the market’s confidence that growth is doing well and that the cut was justified. From there, he remarked that this was more like a ‘mid-cycle’ adjustment which was seemed much more like a one-and-done to traders. Through subsequent questions he tried to clarify that he simply meant to suggest the move wasn’t necessarily the start of a long rate cut cycle. His further rumination that ‘some previous mid-cycle adjustments have seen next moves turn out to be rate hikes’ only assured market confusion. And, in confusion, traders become acutely aware of how vested they are in risk – particularly US-based exposure. $$$$From the Dollar, there was as much back and forth as anything else with any sensitivity to the event; but it never slipped into the ‘red’ of the pre-release levels. Ultimately, if the Dollar was still climbing heading into this event with debate of a 50 bp cut in the backdrop and prevailing speculation between 50 and 75 bps worth of easing in total through year’s end, a higher probability of a single insurance cut certainly wouldn’t put it off a recovery effort. While the Dollar is not clear of resistance across the board – far from it – moves like USDJPY’s rally suggests the Greenback response is perhaps more motivated than risk aversion as of yet. The most impressive move, however, would have to go to the EURUSD which cleared 1.1100 to trade at multi-year lows. $$$$Chart of EURUSD (Daily) $$$$The Dow and other key US indices represent risk trends with an unmistakable advantage afforded by relatively stalwart growth and the belief that the policy authority behind the market could offer additional infusions of lift should conditions start to sputter. The suggestion that they are not as willing to issue preemptive support as market participants had hoped clearly took its toll. The Dow dropped back below 27,000 while the S&P 500 held up at 2,960 but neither seemed willing to yet commit to a full deleveraging. Emerging markets and global capital markets seemed to be equally disturbed by the event, but it is the US markets that are riding on the most over-exaggerated notion of premium and therefore have the most to lose. I will be watching the ratio between the likes of the S&P 500 and the VEU closely moving forward. $$$$Chart of S&P 500 to VEU Rest of World ETF Ratio (Daily)$$$$Another measure that has been carefully calibrated towards US monetary policy these past months is gold. The precious metal has climbed alongside the speculation of impending Fed cuts. The fact that the central bank doesn’t seem as pressed to unwind as the financial system had anticipated would reasonably remove some of the winds from commodity’s sails. That said, a slower pace of accommodative shift doesn’t diminish the ultimate appeal of the market itself. Gold is a haven against stability risks that is exacerbated by the value issues with typical fiat havens which deflate in aggressive easing. The Fed has still capped his tightening cycle for the time being. Furthermore, the ECB is still on pace to reactive a dovish effort and the BOJ never stopped. Consider gold priced in a range of the major currencies. $$$$Chart of Equally-Weighted Gold Index and Consecutive Candle Reading (Weekly)$$$$While the Fed was a clear distraction for the markets this week – and will continue to be a matter the rank will have to evaluate for the context of their exposure for weeks to come – there are other themes for which we must account. Trade wars were put on pause as both Beijing and the White House said talks will resume out in September – a move that seems to echo the suggestion that China is dragging its feet in an attempt to wait out the administration’s tenure. $$$$Economic health is another systemic matter that we would tap into this past session. The Chinese PMIs reflected manufacturing still in contractionary territory, the Chicago-area manufacturing report offered up its worst reading since October 2009 and Japan consumer confidence sank deeper into malaise (37.8 when anything below 50 indicates greater pessimism). The Eurozone’s 2Q GDP reading was the most meaningful update however with 0.2 percent expansion that may have met expectations but halved the previous quarter’s expansion. The tepid growth revives the contrast we saw build relative to the US last week which can also remind us that the ECB seems to be on pace to drop back into extreme easing policy while the Fed gently eases into tepid relief. $$$$Equally-Weighted Euro Index and Rate of Change (Daily)$$$$Looking ahead to Thursday’s session, there is another run of noteworthy event risk on tap, but themes are doing a fair job of distracting from discrete updates. Global manufacturing PMIs are noteworthy, but I will be more concerned with the state of the British Pound. The ‘Sterling’ pulled up from its ‘no deal’ Brexit freefall following new Prime Minister Johnson’s abrupt position on negotiations thanks to something of a capitulatory tone he took likely to stem the bleeding. To build on that Wednesday, reports started to circulate suggesting a two-year seize fire may be reached with the European Union even as they stand separated but without all the details worked out.$$$$Chart of EURGBP and Rate of Change (Daily)$$$$It is this constant state of uncertainty against which the Bank of England rate decision will be judged. This particular gathering will draw an inordinate amount of interest for the Brexit backdrop but also the reticence from the Fed to fully give over to stimulus. Is the BOE more hawkish or dovish than the stature of the Fed? Is it higher or lower on the spectrum relative to the ECB? What insight will they offer as far as the growth implications of Brexit under the new stewardship of Boris Johnson? The answer to these questions can alter course and pace of the Pound.$$$$If you want to download my Manic-Crisis calendar, you can find the updated file here. $$$$Following the fireworks from the Fed, the market is likely more sensitive to global monetary policy and key US data. It is therefore wise to keep an eye on the BOE rate decision Thursday and Friday NFPs. Join us we cover these two events live! Sign up on the Webinar Calendar. 
EURUSD Drops as ECB Paves Way for Rate Cut and QE Restart	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/25/EURUSD-Drops-as-ECB-Paves-Way-Rate-Cut-and-QE-Restart.html	1564056000	 ECB changes forward guidance towards easing, rate cut warranted in September $$$$ New round of bond purchases will be announced  $$$$ Tiered rates may be introduced to mitigate negative rate impact on banks 	 EURUSD saw some volatility prior to the announcement as the pair spiked to 1.1149 before dropping back to around 1.1120 as the ECB kept rates unchanged but signalled further monetary stimulus to come in September. $$$$ A key takeaway from this meeting are the changein the Central Bank’s forward guidance, shifting from keeping rates at current levels to keeping them at current or lower levels until mid-2020, signalling that they are prepared to lower rates in the September meeting, possibly taking the deposit rate 10 bps lower to -0.5%. Analyst views and expectations for this meeting were relatively split as some believed that the outcome would only yield information about further monetary stimulus whilst some believed the bank would take immediate action towards growing risks by cutting rates, with some analysts even predicting a 20-bps cut. This saw the EURUSD spike higher after the announcement but quickly correct lower pushing down past 1.1120 as expected. $$$$ Another key point is that the ECB is considering introducing a tiered margining system to mitigate the impact that negative rates have on banks’ profitability, meaning that lower rates are intended for longer. They also signalled further asset purchases to come but given that the ECB has purchased 2 trillion euros of bonds since 2015, it is nearing its self-imposed ceiling of not owning more than a third of a country’s debt, which could see them increase the issuer limits to allow for further stimulus. $$$$ A report released earlier this month by the IMF said that the Eurozone would continue to face unprecedented risks stemming from trade wars, Brexit and Italy, and that the ECB should keep monetary policy accommodative as the19-nation currency bloc will face slowing growth in the coming year.  $$$$ TLTROs: What they are and how the influence the economy $$$$ Negative rates and TLTROs $$$$ Focus on Draghi’s Meeting minutes for more insight into the ECB’s monetary policy and forward guidance at 1230 GMT which could see further volatility for the EUR. $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ KEY TRADING RESOURCES: $$$$ --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst $$$$ To contact Daniela, email her at Daniela.Sabin@ig.com $$$$ Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin 
EUR Softer Ahead of ECB, IFO Figures Continue to Show Weakness	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/25/EUR-Softer-Ahead-of-ECB-IFO-Figures-Continue-to-Show-Weakness.html	1564043400	 Weaker IFO figures reinforce a slowing German economy suggested by weaker than expected PMIs $$$$ German bond yields at their lowest level on record as investor expectations worsen $$$$ EURUSD continues to head towards two-year lows of 1.1076 ahead of ECB rate decision meeting 	 Join our analyst Nick Cawley for live coverage of the ECB rate decision meeting at 1130 GMT $$$$ The Eurozone continues to show weakness as business confidence in Germany suffers another blow. The common currency was feeling the heat of the rate decision this morning as it traded lower against most G10 currencies.  $$$$ EURUSD May Break Through Critical Support After ECB Rate Decision $$$$ EURUSD was trading mostly unchanged heading into the European open but the Euro bears managed to regain control and pushed the pair close to the 1.1128 support line in anticipation of German IFO figures to be released, ahead of the ECB rate decision meeting. EURGBP was losing some of the gains it had been steadily making since the beginning of May, but this was partly due to a rebound in sterling (GBP) as traders continue to digest the news about Boris Johnson’s election as PM. The pair was trading at month-lows of 0.8920 at the start of the session. $$$$ Business climate in Germany for the month of July was 95.7 well below expectations of 97.0, and down from the previous month’s figure of 97.4. Current sentiment continues to show weakness in the Germany economy falling below 100 to 99.4, whilst future expectations were down to 95.7. These lacklustre figures come on the back of weakening PMI figures released yesterday, where manufacturing PMI continued to fall further below the 50 line, falling two points from 45.0 to 43.1, hitting an 84-month low amidst fears that slowing growth and trade disruption could push the country into a recession. The economic boom seen in the last ten years has come to an end leading into a sideways movement that could result in a downturn.  $$$$ German Bund yields are trading at their lowest level ever, with the latest round of 10-year bonds offering a yield of minus 0.38%, down from minus 0.24% in June. The lowering yields come amid fears of a global economic slowdown which has been pushing prices of highly rated bonds higher, meaning that investors who purchase these bonds and hold them to maturity are likely to make a loss. Bond prices have been soaring in the last few months on the back of expectations that the ECB would reintroduce monetary stimulus coupled with a host of negative data from Germany, which has kept bond yields heading lower. $$$$ All four PMIs across the Eurozone failed to reach expectations, signalling one of the weakest expansions in recent years, and giving up the mild gains seen in the month of June. The case for a rate cut from the ECB is strengthening but it is unlikely that a cut will come in today’s meeting, with expectations that Mario Draghi will announce the terms of a new round of QE, cementing the basis for a 10 bps cut to come in September if economic conditions do not improve.  $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ KEY TRADING RESOURCES: $$$$ --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst $$$$ To contact Daniela, email her at Daniela.Sabin@ig.com $$$$ Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin 
Stock Market Outlook: Top 3 Themes to Watch in AAPL Earnings	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/30/Stock-Market-Outlook-Top-3-Themes-to-Watch-in-AAPL-Earnings.html	1564502400	AAPL is one of the world’s largest publicly traded companies and is viewed as a stock market bellwether by some – affording the company significant sway over equity sentiment.$$$$Trade war headwinds or concerns likely carry the largest implications for the broader market, while stock-specific themes may damage AAPL shares directly $$$$Interested in other stock market insight? Sign up for the Weekly Equity Webinar.	AAPL stock traded higher on Monday, likely in anticipation of quarterly results due Tuesday. The tech-giant currently stands as the second largest publicly traded company by market capitalization and some stock traders look to the corporation as a bellwether for the larger equity market. Consequently, Apple’s earnings report can carry significant implications for the entire equity market and have even sparked a currency flash crash. That said, there are various themes to watch, ranging from trade war concerns to sector-specific headwinds. Here are the three most important. $$$$The first, and likely most important theme to be cognizant of, is commentary on the ongoing US-China trade war. Any indication that the trade spat has weighed, or will weigh, on earnings more than originally anticipated will likely rattle both Apple and broad-market investors alike. Given the company’s brand loyalty, size and robust cash reserves, it is widely believed Apple is well suited to withstand transitory threats. With that in mind, Apple shares may grapple with any negative development comparatively well while the broader market – comprised of company’s that do not enjoy the same attributes as Apple – may suffer the consequences. The broader equity implications this theme can carry make it the most important on the list.$$$$Last week, Apple announced a $1 billion acquisition of Intel’s (INTC) smartphone modem business. The deal was inked to further progress Apple’s 5G technology for iPhones, but also carries consequences for another member of the tech sector – Qualcomm (QCOM). While the technology is still far from launch, the enhanced in-house capability for Apple will eventually allow Apple to avoid royalty payments to Qualcomm that total around $2 billion a year according to Bloomberg. $$$$Interested in longer-term trades? Check out our Third Quarter Forecasts for Gold, EURUSD, the Dow Jones and more.$$$$While the acquisition does not have an immediate impact for the parties involved, it may weigh on QCOM earnings in the future while allowing Apple to provide stable pricing. Therefore, what investors should look for in the earnings call on Tuesday is any commentary regarding the timeline and corresponding cost-cutting or revenue forecasts from the freshly-signed deal. This is likely to have the least impact on the broader-market, but could directly influence AAPL, INTC and QCOM. $$$$Finally, Apple investors await answers on the progress of the corporation’s services arm. Under CEO Tim Cook, the iPhone-maker has pursued an expansion of paid-services like Apple Music, iTunes, Apple Pay, and a new credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs. The service business has become an increasingly large, and therefore important, portion of Apple’s total revenue. As iPhone sales continue to plateau, further growth in the services sector will become the most critical aspect of the company’s earnings report. It will also help the California-based company compete with competitors like Microsoft (MSFT) which has already transitioned heavily into providing services versus hardware. $$$$While the three themes carry different possibilities for Apple’s share price and potential to impact the broader market, each of them has the ability to spark volatility. That said, a highly anticipated rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday has helped to depress Apple’s implied volatility ahead of earnings. $$$$To that end, the implied price-range after earnings is just $17. Despite the relatively acute range, it encompasses one notable point of resistance around $215. The level marks the stock’s swing high on May 1 and could arguably pose as the right brim of a prolonged cup and handle pattern. $$$$While the signal’s formation is far from perfect, a cup and handle pattern is typically followed by a bullish breakout when the cup’s brim is surpassed. An encouraging quarterly performance could see fundamentals align with technicals and drive AAPL shares through resistance at $215. Such a development would assist the stock in reclaiming all-time highs around $233.

Bitcoin Price Chart is Coiled like a Spring, will it Bounce or Break?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/30/Bitcoin-Price-Chart-is-Coiled-like-a-Spring-will-it-Bounce-or-Break.html	1564506000	Bitcoin is up 153% in the year-to-date, but recent price action suggests the crypto’s bullish trend is threatened.$$$$To that end, an ascending trendline from mid-May could mark the line in the sand for medium-term BTCUSD price.$$$$Interested in cryptocurrency? Check out our Bitcoin Predictions & Facebook Libra Podcast with Tone Vays.	After surging 260% in 2019 to nearly $14,000 last month, Bitcoin is taking a breather and threatening a critical tailwind to its continuation higher. The ascending trendline from mid-May provided support in June and has done so again in late July. A series of recent tests have probed the line, but bulls appear unwilling to surrender at this time. That said, hourly stochastic RSI is tiptoeing into overbought territory and could see bears pressure price back down to the level – which now enjoys confluence with a Fibonacci level at $9,545. If confluent support is unable to rebuke bears at this level, it is a worrisome sign for Bitcoin in the coming days.$$$$Interested in longer-term trades? Check out our Third Quarter Forecasts for Gold, EURUSD and more.$$$$Chart created in TradingView.$$$$Over the longer-term however, stochastic RSI is wading in oversold territory as RSI continues to trend lower alongside price. Should the confluence of support keep Bitcoin afloat and allow bulls to retake control, resistance may reside at the 50% retracement level around $11,525 and around $12,000 marked by the descending trendline from June’s high. If price holds above support, BTC may work itself into somewhat of a wedge marked by the converging trendlines. $$$$Chart created in TradingView.$$$$If, on the other hand, Bitcoin bulls are unable to hold above $9,545, a break beneath could quickly accelerate into a larger move as bullish bets unfold and the overarching trend higher is called into question. In this circumstance, initial support would look to reside around $7,093 – marked by the 23.6% Fib level. Further, Bitcoin volatility has been relatively muted as the cryptocurrency slowly bleeds to support but a failure at this level would likely spark volatility as traders look to reposition amid the new technical landscape. $$$$--Written by Peter Hanks, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Contact and follow Peter on Twitter @PeterHanksFX.$$$$Read more:Stock Market Outlook: Top 3 Themes to Watch in AAPL Earnings.
EURUSD Directionless on EZ Mixed Data, Awaits Fed Rate Decision	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/31/EURUSD-Directionless-on-EZ-Mixed-Data-Awaits-Fed-Rate-Decision.html	1564565400	EURUSD recovered some ground in the morning session but mixed EZ data failed to provide a direction ahead of the Fed’s rate decision.$$$$German inflation managed to pick up slightly in the month of July, but Eurozone price growth remains uncomfortably low, ECB under pressure to provide further stimulus.$$$$A host of US data is expected to keep the pair highly volatile throughout the day.	EURUSD has been on the upswing most of the week as key data is released. The pair broke above the 1.1150 line on Tuesday as German inflation for the month of July proved to be better than expected, easing some concerns about its economy. The pair was also helped by some dollar weakness seen on the back of a possible fallout on Chinese – US trade talks currently underway in Shanghai. The dollar has also remained subdued as investors await the highly anticipated Fed rate decision to be announced later today, with expectations that current rates will be cut 25-bps points to 200-225bps, with some even talking about a 50-bps cut, although this may be an outlier. Despite the US economy performing well with a “robust” jobs market, the cut in rates is warranted mostly to keep in line with other Central Banks and to minimise the risk of a possible recession on the back of Donald Trump’s trade war with China. Tune into DailyFX Chief Strategist John Kicklighter’s live webinarcovering the FOMC rate decision.$$$$EURUSD Q3 Forecast.$$$$German retail and employment figures out this morning also provided some relief to the German economy as retail sales grew 3.5% in June after falling 1.7% in the month of May. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5% in the month of July, but unemployment claims increase by 1k rather than 2k initially expected. French and Spanish data provided a gloomier picture for the euro as French inflation turned negative with prices falling 0.2% in the latest month bringing the yearly figure to 1.1%, well below the 2% price target set by the ECB. French GDP also took a hit as the yearly growth fell to 1.1% from 1.2% and below expectations of 1.3%. The Spanish economy only grew 0.5% in the second quarter of the year, below expectations of 0.6%, bringing yearly GDP to 2.3%. $$$$Eurozone Headline inflation fell to 1.1% in July as prices have been in a steady decline since the beginning of the year. Core inflation, which excludes volatile prices, fell to 0.9%, below expectations of 1%. The continued fall in prices within the Eurozone has become a cause of concern for many economists as the current situation increases the risks of entering a deflationary spiral that can lead to stagflation. Despite the ECB having various monetary stimulus tools in place for the last few years, prices have failed to pick up to their desired target of around 2%. With their forward guidance having been changed in the latest meeting to accommodate the need for more monetary stimulus, the question remains whether the Central Bank can actually mange to influence prices and if their reaction of stopping any stimulus as soon as prices start to pick up may not be the most accurate. To try and achieve better price stability Mario Draghi has commented that the ECB will study their current inflation goal so that it is more accommodative with trying to achieve symmetry around the 2% goal. $$$$The Eurozone economy grew 0.2% in the month of July which led to yearly GDP being 1.1%, above expectations of just 1%. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.5% in June but the May figure was revised downward to 7.6%.$$$$ Euro Forecast Trading Guide.$$$$The mixed sentiment from the Eurozone data leaves EURUSD highly sensitive to US data to consolidate a direction.Out later today we also have ADP nonfarm employment change which gives some insight into Nonfarm Payroll figures to be released on Friday. We can expect to see some volatility in US pairs on the back of this, leading into oil inventory figures and then finally the Fed rate decision at 1800 GMT. With enough data to keep markets busy, any break below 1.1130 will see EURUSD continue to head towards monthly-lows of 1.1110.$$$$Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor.$$$$KEY TRADING RESOURCES:$$$$--- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst.$$$$To contact Daniela, email her at Daniela.Sabin@ig.com.$$$$Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin.

EUR/USD Rate at Risk Ahead of US Inflation, Eurozone ZEW Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/08/12/eur-usd-rate-at-risk-ahead-of-us-inflation-eurozone-zew-data.html	1565638740	EURUSD overnight implied volatility jumps to multi-week highs as forex traders eye Tuesday’s release of US CPI data and ZEW’s Eurozone economic sentiment survey $$$$US inflation that remains tepid and persistently pessimistic Eurozone outlook will likely weigh on expectations for additional monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and European Central Bank (ECB) $$$$IG Client Sentiment data on spot EURUSD indicates that the recent price trend could soon reverse higher 	EURUSD continues to show signs of attempting to rebound higher and Tuesday’s trading session could provide forex traders with additional evidence that the Euro may be putting in a bottom against the US Dollar. Although central bank dovishness is being felt across the market, the rise in Fed rate cut bets are anticipated to outweigh those for the ECB which could help spot EURUSD solidify its footing above the 1.12 handle. As such, spot EURUSD will likely turn to upcoming Eurozone ZEW economic sentiment and US inflation report data releases for insight on the currency pair’s next direction.$$$$Risk reversal metrics for EURUSD, which have soared since President Trump threatened additional tariffs on China in the latest US-China trade war escalation earlier this month, hints at the growing demand for call options and upside protection relative. A reading above 0 indicates the premium for call option volatility exceeds the premium for put option volatility. Thus, the EURUSD overnight risk reversal reading of 0.295 implies that currency option traders have a bullish bias regarding spot prices by contract expiry Tuesday. $$$$Yet, spot EURUSD selling pressure could be sparked if another downbeat ZEW Economic Sentiment Survey out of the EU sinks the Euro. The headline ZEW survey figure for August, which is slated for release at 9:00 GMT according to the DailyFX Economic Calendar, has remained subdued around -20 since October 2018 aside from briefly turning positive for a month this past April. Another sharp drop in the indicator could foretell further deterioration in the Eurozone’s already-sluggish economy, which has potential to accelerate expectations for ECB stimulus. $$$$Spot EURUSD price action could whipsaw or intensify later in Tuesday’s trading session if July US inflation data generates a response when released at 12:30 GMT. Stubbornly-tame inflation has become a growing concern of the Federal Reserve and a primary factor contributing to the July FOMC meeting interest rate cut along with US-China trade war uncertainty. If the reading on core CPI comes in below consensus estimates of 2.1%, it could spur additional Fed rate cut bets and drag down the US Dollar.$$$$That said, EURUSD overnight implied volatility reading of 6.91% sets the currency pair’s 1-standard deviation trading range at 1.1172-1.1254. EURUSD bulls will likely look to technical resistance posed by the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of its year-to-date high and low before eying the upper bound of the option implied trading range. Looking to potential downside in spot EURUSD, the envelope of moving averages could provide a degree of buoyancy for prices. However, EURUSD bears could target the psychologically-significant 1.12 handle before driving spot prices to test the lower bound of the option implied trading range or technical support provided by the 23.6% Fib. $$$$According to IG Client Sentiment data, 51.0% of spot EURUSD retail traders are net-long with the ratio of longs-to-shorts at 1.04. The number of traders net-long is 21.4% lower than last week whereas the number of traders net-short is 38.8% higher than last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EURUSD price trend may soon reverse higher despite the fact traders remain net-long seeing that we typically take a contrarian view on crowd sentiment. $$$$-- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com.$$$$Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight.

Q3 2019 EUR Forecast and USD Top Trading Opportunities and Forecasts $$$$ Keep up to date with all key economic data and event releases via the DailyFX Economic Calendar $$$$ EURUSD price action is currently setting up for a triangular breakout ahead of two important central bank meetings this month. The triangle’s vertex, defined by higher lows and lower highs, falls due around the time of the next ECB meeting on July 25 where the central bank is expected to outline a potential 10 basis point cut to the deposit rate to -0.5%. ECB President Mario Draghi may also prepare the market for another round of quantitative easing (bond buying), especially if economic data remains weak. $$$$  In the US, the FOMC meeting on July 31 is fully expected to result in a 0.25% interest rate cut as Fed chair Jerome Powell looks to head off any economic slowdown. While interest rate cuts in the US have now been priced in over the last 2-3 months, the realization that the ECB has changed course and now needs to provide fresh monetary stimulus has weakened the Euro and may well weaken it further in the coming months. $$$$ On the daily chart the triangular set-up over the last few is clear. The floor is currently a few pips under 1.1200, while the spot price is currently 1.1230 and falling.

Eurozone unemployment at lowest level since 2008, EURUSD to watch US ISM data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/01/Eurozone-unemployment-at-lowest-level-since-2008-EURUSD-to-watch-US-ISM-data.html	1561973400	 EURUSD recovered some of the losses it suffered in the Asian session as German and Eurozone unemployment figures provide some relief $$$$ Eurozone unemployment fell to 7.5% in May, its lowest level since 2008, but failed to spark a reaction in the market as focus remains on trade war developments 	 An upbeat German unemployment change figure managed to curb EURUSD losses this morning as the pair traded softer throughout most of the Asian session on the back of a “cease-fire” on Sino-American trade wars. Unemployment fell by 1k in the month of June easing some of the pressure last month’s downbeat figures placed on the growth forecasts for the country, but markets had expected a greater reduction of 3k. $$$$ The 1k fall in unemployment proved to be enough to convince the EURUSD bulls to push the pair higher. The Asian session started with large drops as the pair reached 1.1317 at the start of the European session, it’s lowest level since June 21. After an initial drop when the figures were released the pair managed to push higher to 1.1331 where it continued to trade as Eurozone unemployment figures were released. Despite unemployment being lower than expected and at its lowest level since 2008, the figure failed to induce a big move in the market  $$$$ Despite employment figures in Germany having returned to their “normal” positive side after unemployment in May unexpectedly jumped by 60k, the reduction in this month’s unemployment change still doesn’t prove that the German economy is improving. After the figure soared last month we could have expected to see unemployment change fall by a much greater numbers, seeing as the average fall in unemployment in the 10 months prior to May’s increase was 12.3k.  $$$$ Last month’s jump marked its biggest rise since 2009, a big contrast to the figures released in April which showed that the unemployment rate was at its lowest in 30 years at 4.9%. The rise in unemployed sparked concerns as the EU’s largest economy had previously halved its growth forecasts for 2019, reflecting a worsening of the economy and general slowdown in the Eurozone led by a recession in the manufacturing sector. Unemployment in the Eurozone fell to 7.5% in May, down from 7.6% in the previous month.  $$$$ Also released this morning were manufacturing PMIs which came in lower for Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Eurozone, proving that the industry continues to struggle as all readings, except for France’s, come in below the 50 line which marks a contraction. The worst figure continues to be from Germany at a reading of 45, specifically worrying as it currently stands as the Eurozone’s largest economy, but it relies greatly on the manufacturing export industry. $$$$ US ISM manufacturing and employment data out later today could see big moves for EURUSD as markets continue to look for results from recent trade wars. A worse than expected reading could correct the pair’s current downtrend and return to levels close to 1.1360, and a better than expected reading could see further confidence in USD pushing the pair lower and below the 1.1300 line. $$$$ Figures released last week saw Eurozone headline inflation remained unchanged at 1.2% whilst core inflation bounced back to 1.1%, up from 0.8% in the previous month. The better than expected figures may have eased off some of the pressure the ECB faces to continue to reduce interest rates to induce monetary stimulus, but the figure is still well below the 2% target and considering that monetary stimulus has been in place for some time one would expect inflation to be at, or much closer to, 2%. $$$$ DailyFX Economic Calendar $$$$ Recommended Reading $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ KEY TRADING RESOURCES: $$$$ --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst $$$$ To contact Daniela, email her at Daniela.Sabin@ig.com $$$$ Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin 
EURUSD Fails to Push Higher As Eurozone PMIs Are Mixed	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/06/21/EURUSD-Fails-to-Push-Higher-As-Eurozone-PMIs-Are-Mixed.html	1561105800	 The lack of data leaves EUR pairs exposed to PMI figures which provided a mixed feeling $$$$ Germany PMIs have improved from last month, but its manufacturing industry is still experiencing contraction $$$$ The EU finds itself with increasing risk factors as it faces various challenges within its borders  $$$$ French services and manufacturing PMIs are both better than expected and above the 50 mark 	 EURUSD experienced a small boost this morning as German PMIs were released ahead of the Eurozone figures. Both services and manufacturing PMIs in Germany were higher than expected which push the pair up to 1.1317 before coming back to trade around 1.1310 in anticipation of wider Eurozone figures out a half hour later. The pair then corrected some of its gains as Eurozone figures came in mixed, with services beating expectations but manufacturing PMI falling short. EURGBP followed roughly the same trend as the lack of other data left EUR pairs exposed to these PMI figures. The pair pushed higher throughout the morning surpassing the 0.8913 mark before correcting on the release of Eurozone PMI figures and retreating to 0.8904. $$$$ German June Manufacturing PMI was up to 45.4 (Exp. 44.6) from the previous 44.3 and Services PMI was 55.6 (Exp. 55.3) up from 55.4 in the previous month. But investors remain wary about the health of Eurozone’s largest economy because despite the figures having improved from the previous month a number below 50 indicates contraction which means that the manufacturing industry, which is a big part of Germany’s export-led economy, continues to slow down, albeit at a slower rate.  $$$$ Eurozone June Manufacturing PMI was 47.8 below expectations of 48 but above last month’s reading of 47.7. Services PMI for the month of June was 53.4, beating expectations of 53 and above last month’s reading of 52.9. French June Manufacturing PMI was 52 (Exp. 50.9) above last month’s 50.6 and Services PMI was 53.1 (exp. 51.6) up from last month’s 51.5. $$$$ Risk in the Eurozone has continued to increase as the EU finds itself with many open fronts, including ongoing Brexit concerns, Italy’s threat of a parallel currency to overcome its budget indiscipline, and the stalled talks with Switzerland over their various trading accords. It seems like more relationships between the member countries and the Central Government are getting strained and deteriorating sentiment in a moment when the EU finds itself with most of its top jobs up for grabs.  $$$$ And as mentioned by Mario Draghi in his opening speech in the Sintra forum on Tuesday, the Eurozone continues to face challenges and the ECB is prepared to increase its monetary easing policy if economic conditions continue to worsen. Eurozone bond yields, which measure the reward investors get for their investment, have continued to fall as bond prices increase, measuring the increased perception of risk that investor’s see within the Eurozone. $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ KEY TRADING RESOURCES: $$$$ --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst $$$$ To contact Daniela, email her at Daniela.Sabin@ig.com $$$$ Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin 
NZD/USD Implied Volatility Soars Ahead of RBNZ Rate Review	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/06/25/nzd-usd-implied-volatility-soars-ahead-of-rbnz-rate-review.html	1561493100	 NZD/USD overnight implied volatility skyrockets above 15 percent for the third time in the last 12 months  $$$$ The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will provide its latest monetary policy update early Wednesday and is motivating heightened expected price action in NZD forex pairs  $$$$ Join DailyFX Analyst David Cottle for live webinar coverage of the June RBNZ Rate Decision and the market’s reaction  	 Overnight swaps are pricing in a mere 20.5 percent chance that the June RBNZ meeting this Wednesday at 2:00 GMT will reveal a 25 basis point cut to the central bank’s policy interest rate.Low rate cut expectations for tomorrow are likely driven largely by the relatively upbeat trade balance data report released on Monday and considering the RBNZ just cut rates at its last meeting back in May. $$$$ Although rate traders are expecting the RBNZ to leave its overnight cash rate (OCR) unchanged at 1.5 percent, elevated readings on New Zealand Dollar implied volatility measures suggest that tomorrow’s monetary policy update will largely impact the anticipation of another rate move at the August 6 meeting.  $$$$ Judging by NZD/USD overnight implied volatility of 15.6 percent, which is the highest reading since May 7, the currency pair is estimated to fluctuate within a 1-standard deviation trading band between 0.6596 and 0.6704. The calculated lower and upper barriers of the 109-pip range surrounding spot NZD/USD closely aligns with the 23.6 percent and 50.0 percent retracement levels of the 2019 trading range.  $$$$ Sharpen your skills as a trader with this free educational guide covering How to Trade Forex News $$$$ If the RBNZ and Governor Orr take a relatively hawkish stance on Wednesday, markets could begin to reducing bets that the central bank cuts again in August which will likely boost the kiwi and threatens to push spot NSD/USD toward the 0.67 handle. Although, upside must first overcome technical resistance posed by the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement. Conversely, if the RBNZ and Governor Orr choose to tee up a near-certain rate cut in August with dovish language tomorrow, it is probable that the New Zealand Dollar will swoon in response. In this case, NZD/USD threatens to push lower towards support around the psychologically-significant 0.6600 price level.  $$$$ Check out IG’s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, Gold, Bitcoin and S&P500.  $$$$ According to IG Client Sentiment data, 70.7 percent of retail traders are net-long spot NZD/USD resulting in a long-to-short ratio of 2.41. Yet, relative to last week, the number of traders net-long is 31.0 percent lower while the number of traders net-short is 7.3 percent higher. As retail trader positioning data is generally interpreted with a contrarian lens, recent changes in spot NZD/USD positioning could hint that the New Zealand Dollar’s climb since June 14 may soon reverse lower.

Forex Volatility: EURUSD, AUDJPY & USDCNH Eye Data, G20 Summit	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/06/24/forex-volatility-eurusd-audjpy-usdcnh-eye-data-g20-summit.html	1561401480	 Currency volatility is expected to creep higher according to rising implied volatility readings  $$$$ Spot EURUSD, AUDJPY and USDCNH eye upcoming economic data and the highly-anticipated G20 summit meeting between Trump and Xi  $$$$ Improve your trading with IG Client Sentiment Data 	 Currency traders will likely hone in on high-impact economic data releases out of the United States and Eurozone this week while awaiting the long-anticipated G20 summit in Osaka, Japan which kicks off on Friday. Due to rising uncertainty surrounding global growth, central bank policy and trade relations between the US and China, it is not surprising that implied volatility readings for EURUSD, AUDJPY and USDCNH have similarly ticked higher.  $$$$ Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendarfor a comprehensive list of upcoming events and data releases for major currencies and markets which is updated in real-time with actual, estimated, and prior economic indicator readings.  $$$$ Tuesday’s trading session will provide markets with the first take from Fed Chair Jerome Powell since the June FOMC statement released last week. Commentary from Powell may provide further insight on the Fed’s latest dovish leaning and when the central bank might begin to ease monetary policy. Prior to Powell taking the spotlight on Tuesday at 17:00 GMT, the US Consumer Confidence Index will be released at 14:00 GMT which looks to reveal an assessment of current business and labor market conditions as well as consumer expectations about the future. This report, along with Wednesday’s release of durable goods orders and advance goods trade balance data, has potential to weigh in on the market’s expectations for the Fed to cut rates this year which will undoubtedly impact the US Dollar.  $$$$ Also on the economic data front, Eurozone and US inflation measures will be released on Friday at 9:00 GMT and 12:30 GMT respectively. As such, spot EURUSD risks experiencing heightened price action over the near-term which is also suggested by the jump in EURUSD implied volatility. Judging by the 1-week implied volatility of 6.27 percent, spot EURUSD is estimated to trade between 1.1486-1.1288 with a 68 percent statistical probability.  $$$$ If recent trend in Eurozone and US economic data continues, EURUSD has potential to keep climbing higher – particularly if technical resistance from the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of its year-to-date high and low can be overcome. Conversely, upbeat data out of the United States threatens to derail lofty Fed rate cut bets and bolster the greenback relative to the Euro. In this scenario, spot EURUSD could slide back towards major confluence around the 1.13 handle where the currency pair may find support from the 38.2 percent Fib.  $$$$ Despite a relatively quiet Economic Calendar for Australia and Japan, spot AUDJPY looks set to form its next leg after consolidating over the last 10 days. While price action in AUDJPY may take cue from the high-impact economic readings elsewhere, market expectations surrounding the start of the G20 summit largely threatens to largely overshadow the hard data. That being said, spot AUDJPY might be expected to fluctuate within a 1-standard deviation trading band of 73.690 and 75.714 calculated using its 1-week implied volatility reading of 9.78 percent – the highest reading since May 15.  $$$$ Recent commentary from RBA Governor Lowe questioning the limitations of looser monetary policy looks to keep the Australian Dollar bid, but lingering anti-risk sentiment threatens to be reignited if traders lack optimism over the Trump-Xi meeting at the upcoming G20 summit which could send spot AUDJPY swooning.  $$$$ With much riding on the US China trade war meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies, USDCNH 1-week implied volatility is skyrocketing and touching its highest level May 13. According to the 6.49 percent 1-week implied volatility currently priced in by forex option traders, spot USDCNH is expected to swing between 6.8118 and 6.9354 with a 68 percent statistical probability.  $$$$ Spot USDCNH will likely react sharply to whether Sino-American trade relations deteriorate further or if the two countries can find common ground and break the recent impasse subsequent to Trump increasing tariffs on China. That being said, the direction of spot USDCNH over the next few days could serve as a possible bellwether to the market’s expectations for US China trade war progress as we head into the start of the G20 summit on Friday.  $$$$ - Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX $$$$ - Follow @RichDvorakFX on Twitter

EURUSD Remains Strong Despite Mixed Data From Eurozone, Focus on G-20 Meeting	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/06/27/EURUSD-Remains-Strong-Despite-Weak-Data-From-Eurozone-Focus-on-G-20-Meeting.html	1561638600	 EURUSD pushes past 1.1376 as investors brush of weak Eurozone data and remain focused on Trump-Jinping G-20 meeting $$$$ Eurozone downside risk is already priced in the markets, moves in EURUSD will come on the back of USD data and trade war progress  	 EURUSD seemed to push through worse than expected business confidence figures in the Eurozone as the pair continued to trade around its 3-month highs. Despite business confidence figures released at 0900 GMT showing that confidence in the Eurozone has dropped yet again, the pair continued to trade above 1.1376 as it waited for German inflation figures to be released. The pair then dropped slightly to 1.1370 as German figures showed that regional inflation is picking up but the YoY Harmonized ICP remained unchanged in the month of June, and the monthly figure dropped from the previous month. Even though the figures were in line with expectations the drop in monthly HICP dampened trader’s sentiment after local inflation figures released earlier in the day were better than expected. $$$$ The lack of reaction in the Euro after worse than expected inflation and economic sentiment figures proves that investors are already pricing in a slowing Eurozone given that growth has been stagnant for some time and inflation has been an ongoing concern for the ECB, as prices have failed to pick up above the 2% target despite very low interest rates in place for some time. A large part of the pressure on the currency pair comes from the USD side, as a recent dovish-turn from the Fed has left investors worried about the future growth prospects in the US. Key focus remains on tomorrow’s G-20 meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping as a much-anticipated trade deal could finally take place. Nonetheless investors remain weary of the success of such talks and USD pairs are expected to experience heightened volatility ahead of the meeting as different remarks from top US and Chinese leaders lead to confusion about the likelihood of a successful trade deal taking place.  $$$$ Overall sentiment in the Eurozone economy has fallen again as most readings out today came in worse than expected. The economic confidence was down to 103.3 (Exp. 104.70 from 105.1 in the previous month, indicating that sentiment is that the economy in the Eurozone is weakening. The drop is led mostly by the fall in industrial confidence followed by a fall service sentiment and Business climate. Consumer confidence remains at -7.2. $$$$ Other figures released this morning showed that Italian Business and Consumer confidence have both dropped in June, coming in at 100.8 and 109.6 respectively. $$$$ A preliminary reading for German CPI shows that monthly inflation has increased to 0.3% in the month of June, up from 0.2% in May, with the yearly figure at 1.6%, up from 1.4% in May and above expectations of 1.4%. The Harmonized ICP, which compares a country’s inflation figure to those of the members of the EU, was unchanged from the previous month figures, coming in at 0.1% MoM and 1.3% YoY. $$$$ Prices in Spain fell 0.1% in May compared to the month of May as YoY inflation drops to 0.4%, its lowest level since November 2016.

Weaker Dollar Sends EURUSD Higher, Eurozone Core CPI Back Above 1%	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/06/28/Weaker-Dollar-Sends-EURUSD-Higher.html	1561713000	 EURUSD pushes past 1.1390 as downward pressure on the USD coupled with better than expected Eurozone Inflation push the pair higher $$$$ Eurozone inflation remains volatile as it jumps back to 1.1%, closer to the EU’s target rate of 2% $$$$ Italian, French and German CPI figures have all come in better than expected easing some of the pressure the ECB faces to further reduce rates 	 EURUSD was pushing higher this morning on the back of a weaker USD after comments made by Donald Trump about international trade showed a weaker tone towards the G-20 meeting between Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping to be held on Saturday. The pair traded in a tight 15-pip range overnight as investors awaited developments on trade talks to consolidate a direction, but comments made by Mr. Trump set a negative tone in anticipation of tomorrow’s meeting which put downward pressure on USD at the start of the European trading session. $$$$ EURUSD and Risk Asset Wind Up Before G-20 Summit $$$$ Better than expected inflation figures for France released at 0645 GMT helped jump-start EURUSD’s uptrend taking it past 1.13750 after which it continued climbing to 1.1391, where the pair continued to trade when core inflation in the Eurozone surprised higher at 1.1% (exp. 1%), as prices remain volatile jumping above and below the 1% mark in the last few months. $$$$ We can expect increased volatility in FX pairs over the weekend as G-20 meetings unfold. USD pairs will remain especially sensitive to any news about trade talks with a notable upswing in trade sensitive currencies (AUD, NZD) if a trade deal is reached. Any negative sentiment surrounding Trump and Jinping’s meeting will continue to push the dollar lower with the potential for EURUSD to close above 1.1400 (50% retracement) near the March-high of 1.1448 as it continues to create higher highs and higher lows. A bearish outlook could send the pair below the 1.1351 support line. $$$$ Eurozone headline inflation remained unchanged at 1.2% whilst core inflation bounced back to 1.1%, up from 0.8% in the previous month. The better than expected figures may ease off some of the pressure the ECB faces to continue to reduce interest rates to induce monetary stimulus, but the figure is still well below the 2% target and considering that monetary stimulus has been in place for some time one would expect inflation to be at, or much closer to, 2%. $$$$ Preliminary inflation figures for France were positive across the board as YoY CPI was 1.2% in June, up from 0.9% the previous month and MoM inflation was 0.2% beating expectations of no growth at all. Harmonized ICP, which compares a country’s inflation figure to those of the members of the EU, was higher both in the monthly and yearly figure, coming in at 0.3% and 1.2% respectively. $$$$ Italian inflation was also better than expected as monthly and yearly inflation were higher than expected at 0.2% (Exp. 0.1%) and 0.8% (Exp. 0.7%) respectively. Harmonized ICP was 0.1% MoM and 0.8% YoY. $$$$ A preliminary reading for German CPI showed that monthly inflation increased to 0.3% in the month of June, up from 0.2% in May, with the yearly figure at 1.6%, up from 1.4% in May and above expectations of 1.4%. The Harmonized ICP was unchanged from the previous month figures, coming in at 0.1% MoM and 1.3% YoY. $$$$ Prices in Spain fell 0.1% in June compared to the month of May as YoY inflation drops to 0.4%, its lowest level since November 2016. The drop-in prices comes on the back of cheaper energy bills, in contrast to the rise they experienced this time last year.

EUR/USD Rate Drops after Christine Lagarde Nominated Next ECB President	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/02/EURUSD-Rate-Drops-after-Christine-Lagarde-Nominated-Next-ECB-President.html	1562090100	 International Monetary Fund Managing Director and Chairwoman Christine Lagarde has been tapped to replace Mario Draghi as the next president of the European Central Bank. $$$$ The IMF chief has been a prominent supporter of accommodative policy to help the Eurozone recover from the Global Financial Crisis and ensuing Eurozone Debt Crisis. $$$$ The Euro pulled back across the board as traders speculated that a Lagarde-run ECB will be committed to the Draghi-era policy of ultra-low interest rates. 	 Looking for longer-term forecasts on the US Dollar? Check out the DailyFX Trading Guides. $$$$ After months of uncertainty, clarity has emerged regarding the next European Central Bank president. With German Chancellor Angela Merkel able to use her waning political capital to nominate German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen to become the next president of the European Commission, the Eurozone’s second largest economy, France, was able to place one of its own among the next class of EU leaders – and in turn, perhaps securing the most important job in all of Europe: the presidency of the ECB. $$$$ Former French Finance Minister and current International Monetary Fund Managing Director and Chairwoman Christine Lagarde has been tapped to replace Mario Draghi as the next ECB president. The move comes as a complete surprise to market participants, who up until the past few days did not have Lagarde on their radar as a top contender to succeed Draghi as the next ECB president. $$$$ Even though the nomination does not guarantee ascension, all signs point to Christine Lagarde being confirmed as the next ECB president. In recent months, in her capacity as IMF Managing Director and Chairwoman, Lagarde slashed the IMF’s global growth forecasts, describing the situation as a “delicate moment” the global economy. One can read between the lines and see that she was talking about the collateral damage of the US-China trade war. $$$$ To this end, with Eurozone growth flagging and inflation expectations sagging, it would appear that Lagarde will be primed to take the reins from Draghi and continue the accommodative policies of ultra-low rates and asset purchases if necessary (Draghi has talked up the possibility of more stimulus in recent weeks). Decrying the lack of fiscal reform over the past several years, Lagarde is very familiar with the need for the ECB to remain active on the stimulus front. Accordingly, any hopes that the next ECB president would end the era of accommodative policies (i.e. a Jens Weidmann-type) have been dashed. $$$$ Amid the flurry of nominations for the next class of EU leaders, the Euro pulled back quickly from its daily highs. EUR/USD dropped from 1.1312 to as low as 1.1292 over a 15-minute period, before rebounding back to 1.1301 at the time this report was written. Elsewhere, with US equity markets under pressure and US Treasury yields falling, the Japanese Yen was able to take advantage of the shift in news f;ow, with EUR/JPY sliding to its lowest levels of the day following the reports. $$$$ Whether you are a new or experienced trader, DailyFX has multiple resources available to help you: an indicator for monitoring trader sentiment; quarterly trading forecasts; analytical and educational webinars held daily; trading guides to help you improve trading performance, and even one for those who are new to FX trading. $$$$ --- Written by Christopher Vecchio, CFA, Senior Currency Strategist $$$$ To contact Christopher Vecchio, e-mail at cvecchio@dailyfx.com $$$$ Follow him on Twitter at @CVecchioFX $$$$ View our long-term forecasts with the DailyFX Trading Guides

Seeing that volatility generally begets more volatility, it is not surprising that EUR/USD implied volatility measures have taken a nosedive with some tenors recording fresh multi-year lows.  $$$$ In fact, EUR/USD 6-month and 12-month implied volatility readings touched their lowest level since July 2014 and June 2007 respectively while shorter durations have plunged similarly. Lack of price action in spot EUR/USD over the last few months could be attributed to dovish central bank expectations. $$$$ According to overnight swaps, traders are currently expecting both the European Central Bank (ECB) and Federal Reserve (Fed) to ease monetary policy over the coming months primarily in response to deteriorating economic data like slowing GDP growth and weakening labor markets. As such, a “battle of the doves” appears to have emerged with the ECB and Fed communicating their stark readiness to act and shore up their economies.  $$$$ While heightened dovishness by the ECB and Fed could continue dragging EUR/USD implied volatility lower over the short-term – particularly with recent news that IMF’s Christine Lagarde will replace ECB President Mario Draghi at the end of October and US President Trump’s Fed nominations – the extremely low readings of EUR/USD implied volatility risk rebounding higher toward historical averages.  $$$$ Using the current 6-month implied volatility reading of 5.38 percent for spot EUR/USD, the currency pair’s 1-standard deviation estimated trading range can be calculated. As such, spot EUR/USD is expected to trade between 1.0857-1.1709 over the next 6-months with a 68 percent statistical probability. It is noteworthy that the estimated trading range aligns almost perfectly with the 76.4 percent and 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement levels of the forex rate’s ascent from 1.0340 to 1.2556 from January 1, 2017 to February 11, 2018. $$$$ These technical levels of confluence will likely provide an additional layer of support and resistance respectively. That being said, the short-term trading range in spot EUR/USD recorded since November 2018 – roughly between the 1.15 and 1.12 handles – poses a challenge for volatility as the technical levels could limit sharp swings in spot EUR/USD.  $$$$ -- Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com $$$$ Connect with @RichDvorakFX on Twitter for real-time market insight 
EURUSD Price Outlook Poor on Slow Growth, Lagarde Nomination	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/03/EURUSD-Price-Outlook-Poor-on-Slow-Growth-Lagarde-Nomination.html	1562146200	 Eurozone purchasing managers index data for June suggest only minimal economic growth in the region. $$$$ Moreover, Christine Lagarde, who has been nominated to be the next President of the European Central Bank, is regarded as a monetary policy dove. $$$$ Taken together, that suggests further short-term losses for the Euro. 	 The final Eurozone composite purchasing managers index (PMI) edged ahead to 52.2 in June, better than both the “flash” reading of 52.1 and May’s final 51.8. However, that still suggests minimal economic growth in the bloc. $$$$ “The June PMI surveys indicate that the pace of Eurozone economic growth picked up at the end of the second quarter, though it would be wrong to get overly excited by the upturn,” commented Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the data. $$$$ “The survey is indicative of GDP merely rising by just over 0.2% in the second quarter, and a deterioration of business expectations for the year ahead to one of the lowest seen for over four years suggests the business mood remains sombre. Downside risks to the outlook prevail amid trade war worries, rising geopolitical uncertainty and slowing global economic growth,” he added. $$$$ The PMI data in full are shown in the following table from the DailyFX calendar: $$$$ Meanwhile Christine Lagarde, who has been nominated for the position of President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will likely continue with the dovish policy stance of current chief Mario Draghi. Subject to approval by the European Parliament, Lagarde will succeed Draghi when his term expires at the end of October. $$$$ Lagarde, a French lawyer and politician, is currently Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund and was previously French Finance Minister. She is not an economist or monetary policy expert. $$$$ Taken together, Lagarde’s nomination and the PMI data suggest that EURUSD could continue to fall short-term within the upward-sloping channel on the charts. $$$$ Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image) $$$$ For the Euro outlook longer-term, check out our latest free forecasts for Q3 here $$$$ Meanwhile, the prospect of a trade war between the US and the EU over aircraft subsidies could also damage Euro sentiment, although EURUSD is likely to be driven later this week by the US non-farm payrolls data. $$$$ Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, at DailyFX we have many resources to help you: $$$$ --- Written by Martin Essex, Analyst and Editor $$$$ Feel free to contact me via the comments section below, via email at martin.essex@ig.com or on Twitter @MartinSEssex

EURUSD Price Heading For Key Support Levels, Bounce Possible	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/04/EURUSD-Price-Heading-For-Key-Support-Levels-Bounce-Possible.html	1562232600	 Further losses in EURUSD are likely to be limited as the pair nears several important support levels.  $$$$ News that the US and China will resume trade talks could also help the Euro. $$$$ Trader positioning data are sending a bullish signal too. 	 The EURUSD price has steadied just above several important support levels on the chart and is well placed to bounce higher from them. As the hourly chart below shows, the pair has been falling in recent days within a rising channel and could ease to the channel support line, currently at 1.1242. If that support holds, a rally is the most likely outcome. $$$$ Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image) $$$$ There is further support at 1.1225 from a previous resistance line joining the lower highs touched since September 24 last year, as well as at the 50-day moving average at 1.1249, the 100-dma at 1.1251 and the 20-dma at 1.1304. $$$$ As I suggested here yesterday, further short-term losses are possible until these supports are reached but a rally towards the middle of the channel thereafter is likely unless they break. $$$$ You can click here for longer-term forecasts for the Euro and the US Dollar in Q3 $$$$ From a fundamental perspective, much depends on interest rates. Both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank look to be preparing the ground for interest-rate cuts but the Fed is likely to move first, potentially weakening USD. $$$$ Moreover, US President Donald Trump has again pressed the Fed to loosen monetary policy, tweeting: $$$$ Meanwhile, many Eurozone government bond yields have dipped to record lows but that has been outweighed by steep falls in the US-German 10-year government bond yield spread since late April this year. An improvement in overall market optimism on news that US-China trade talks will resume next week has already lifted the US stock market to a record high and could help the Euro too. This follows news that the US trade deficit widened in May by more than forecast to a five-month high. $$$$ Turning to market sentiment, IG retail trader positioning data are currently sending out a bullish signal even though more traders are currently long the pair than are short. $$$$ That said, trading will likely be thin near-term given that US traders are off work for the 4th of July holiday and trading will likely be cautious ahead of US non-farm payroll data Friday. $$$$ How well do you understand chart patterns?

Conservatives Return to Greece, EUR Fails to Consolidate a Direction	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/08/Conservatives-Return-to-Greece-EUR-Fails-to-Consolidate-a-Direction.html	1562581800	 Kyriakos Mitsotakis pledges to reduce taxes and boost growth, although mildly recovered the Greek economy still faces struggles ahead to overcome its bailout-era $$$$ EUR pairs traded in a tight range in the morning session as differing views on the result of the elections keep the common currency without a firm direction  $$$$ Eurozone stability could be in play if other countries believe the Greek government is abusing the bloc’s structure 	 Greece, the Eurozone’s most indebted country, has changed its left-wing populist party as centre-right New Democracy party won Sunday’s election with pledges to reduce taxes and boost growth through investment. $$$$ Alexis Tsipras’s left-wing party Syriza rose to power in 2015 when he pledged to end the era of austerity promising Greeks he would lead the country’s recovery. But his popularity was short-lived as he soon turned on his campaign promise and accepter tougher fiscal measure in order to gain international monetary backing. Four years later, and with Greeks wanting a change of direction, Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s centre-right party New Democracy swept up a majority of votes on Sunday’s elections. The former banker and consultant is no new face to politics as his family is one of the most powerful in Greek politics with both his father and sister having held important roles in the past. $$$$ EUR pairs have remained mostly unchanged throughout the morning session as differing opinions about the change in government keeps the euro from consolidating a direction. Whilst Mr Mitsotakis is viewed as traditionally market-friendly, with promises to improve its business activity and attract foreign investment, he has also pledged to reduce taxes in a time where the Greek economy continues to struggle to pay back the Eurozone on its three bailouts, which have left Greek debt at more than 150% of its GDP. Most EUR pairs received with positivity the result of the election with a push higher for the euro, but the mild gains were quickly corrected throughout the morning session. EURUSD opened the session on Sunday night at 1.1231 after falling below the 1.1230 handle in Friday’s trading session on report of better than expected US jobs data, and the pair has since then traded in a tight 14-pip session. EURJPY has seen the most volatility losing 38 pips in the overnight session before recovering this morning and settling around the 121.75 level. $$$$ 10 years ago the Greek economy was the worst performing in Europe and it only managed to stay within the Eurozone after receiving 300 billion euros in foreign aid, which came with strict austerity restrictions. By 2012 the country’s economy had shrunk by a fifth since the 2008 recession had begun and the government had been urged to cut wages, public spending and pensions in return for receiving financial aid from the IMF, ECB and European Union. The IMF’s head at the time, Christine Lagarde, who is now set to become the new president of the ECB, said that Greek nationals were avoiding their duty to pay taxes which had partly led to the country’s debt crisis, and that the Greek government needed to take responsibility over the actions of its taxpayers in order to reduce the country’s budget deficit and achieve a stable economy. $$$$ The current conditions have improved slightly as the Greek economy has bounced back from its recessionary period, with GDP growing 1.5% and 1.9% in 2017 and 2018 respectively and IMF forecasts showing a 2.4% growth for 2019. In 2017 Greece was able to resume issuing bonds after a blackout period of 3 years but current yields show that perception about the Greek economy is still very low. Greek bonds have returned 20 per cent in the last year, the highest within the Eurozone, as they are considered to be illiquid junk-rated bonds.  $$$$ Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s New Democracy party has focused its campaign on making Greece more business-friendly, hoping for prosperity to come from economic development. His main pledges are to cut taxes, specifically those in place to cover last year’s bailout, and to restructure Greece’s bureaucracy allowing for privatisation and foreign investment. He expects his government to close a painful bailout-era and lead the Greek population to a future of prosperity and growth. $$$$ In good news for the European Union, Kyriakos Mitsotakis is considered to be a firm supporter of the European bloc and believes that further integration is needed. In a time when populist governments have been flourishing increasing the risks to the stability of the Eurozone, the surge of a Euro-backing government is always welcome. But as Greece has been the country that has most heavily relied on Europe’s support over the last 10 years, one would assume that the country would appreciate the favourable terms it has received when borrowing more funds than it has been able to make in revenue through its lacklustre taxing system. The main concern is how the Eurozone’s leading economies feel about the need to continuously rescue those countries that get trapped in a recessionary cycle, and further integration is unlikely to be welcomed by them. $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ KEY TRADING RESOURCES: $$$$ --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst $$$$ To contact Daniela, email her at Daniela.Sabin@ig.com $$$$ Follow Daniela on Twitter @HathornSabin 
USD Price Outlook: More Gains Possible Ahead of Fed Meeting	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/07/09/USD-Price-Outlook-More-Gains-Possible-Ahead-of-Fed-Meeting.html	1562670000	 Bullish factors are beginning to build up for USD. $$$$ They include a growing belief that the Federal Open Market Committee will cut US rates by a quarter of a percentage point rather than by half a point this month. 	 The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is now looking likely to cut US interest rates by 25 basis points rather than 50bps when it meets on July 30-31, and that is likely to keep the US Dollar on its upward trajectory near-term. $$$$ Market pricing is currently suggesting a 97.5% probability that the FOMC will reduce its target range to 2.0%-2.25% from the current 2.25%-2.50%. The chances of a reduction to 1.75%-2.0% are therefore a mere 2.5%, with almost nobody expecting the Fed to leave its target rate unchanged. $$$$ The impact can bee see on the EURUSD chart below, which shows the pair in a steep downward channel. $$$$ Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image) $$$$ Other factors supporting the USD are a relaunch of the US-China trade talks this week and news last week of a higher than expected increase in US non-farm payrolls in June, suggesting that the US economy is performing better than feared. $$$$ However, there is a wild card: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will this week give his semi-annual testimony to Congress, appearing before a House panel Wednesday and a Senate committee Thursday. Clearly, if his testimony is more dovish than expected, talk of a 50bps cut in rates will grow and the USD would likely ease back in response. $$$$ Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, at DailyFX we have many resources to help you: $$$$ --- Written by Martin Essex, Analyst and Editor $$$$ Feel free to contact me via the comments section below, via email at martin.essex@ig.com or on Twitter @MartinSEssex

EUR Hit Hard as Draghi Hints at Further QE, Key Focus on ECB Sintra Panel	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/06/18/EUR-Hit-Hard-as-Draghi-Hints-at-Further-QE-Key-Focus-on-ECB-Sintra-Panel-.html	1560850200	 Draghi hints at further monetary stimulus and sends the Euro tumbling  $$$$ EURUSD falls below 1.1200 for the first time since the beginning of the month, eyeing 1.1180 support level $$$$ ZEW economic sentiment falls sharply as US tariff war continues to dampen growth prospects 	 EUR suffered a hit as Mario Draghi hinted that further monetary stimulus could be needed at his opening speech at the ECB Sintra Panel. The ECB President said that quantitative easing has considerable headroom and the Euro responded by losing significant ground against most major currencies. EURUSD fell 0.35% to 1.1195, its lowest level since the beginning of June and below the psychological 1.1200 handle. The pair could now focus on 1.1180 as the next key support. EURJPY lost 0.45% to 121.216, again nearing levels not seen since the beginning of the month. EURGBP was the pair that remained most resilient after Draghi’s comments as investors still lack confidence in GBP and remain cautious.  $$$$ A busy few days lie ahead for EURUSD traders as both the ECB and the Fed are due to give insight on the future of their economies. ECB officials including Mario Draghi will be speaking at a forum in Portugal this week, with key focus on a policy panel with BoE governor Mark Carney due to take place today at 1400 GMT. Wednesday will see the Fed release their interest rate decision where investors will play close attention for any updates on their expectations about future growth and the likelihood of any rate cuts. $$$$ DailyFX Economic Calendar $$$$ EURGBP continues to be Brexit focused as the pair mostly trades sideways with heightened volatility experienced when UK political events occur. Focus will be on BoE governor Mark Carney’s stance on the future of the economy and the need for more monetary stimulus, although it is expected that he will continue to have a wait-and-see stance until the Brexit uncertainty clears. $$$$ Increasing the downward pressure on the Euro was the release of the German Zew survey which revealed that economic expectations have decreased to -21.81 in the month of June, down from -2.1 in the previous month and well below expectations of -5.8. Although economic sentiment in Germany, which is greatly influenced by the manufacturing sector, was expected to worsen because of the increased trade tensions that culminated in US tariffs being imposed on Mexico, the figure came in much worse than expected which continued the Euro sell-off across the board. Economic sentiment in Germany has fallen back in to the deep negative, close to its lowest level of -24.7 seen in July and October 2018. The figure picked up gradually at the beginning of 2019 offering a positive reading of 3.1 in the month of April before falling back below 0 in May. $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ KEY TRADING RESOURCES: $$$$ --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst

The selloff was sparked after the latest DoE crude oil inventory data showed a stockpile reduction of 282K barrels, which compares to an estimate of a 1,360K barrel drawdown and a previous build of 4,740K barrels.  $$$$ Today’s sharp drop in crude oil marks the 6th decline in excess of 1 percent this month as oil bulls begin to lose conviction. The aggressive selling in crude has now pushed oil prices below key technical support around the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the December 24 low to the most recent high printed on April 23. The 50 percent retracement level near $55/bbl could be a probable downside target as oil bears gain momentum. Also, recent selling pressure threatens to accelerate with oil prices hinging on global growth risks and if speculative traders further unwind long bets. $$$$ Check outthis real-time Client Positioning Sentiment Tracker to see the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold, Bitcoin, and S&P500 traders.  $$$$ According to IG client positioning data, 58.0 percent of crude oil traders remain net-long with the ratio of longs-to-shorts at 1.38.

EURUSD Regains Some Strength, Bond Yields Signal a Recession	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/05/31/EURUSD-Regains-Some-Strength-Bond-Yields-Signal-a-Recession.html	1559302200	 EURUSD was trading higher throughout the morning but German CPI figures and US PCE Core could revert the uptrend $$$$ Downward pressure on long-term yields have inverted the yield curve, an occurrence which has preceded most recessions since WWII $$$$ Markets are pricing in two rate cuts by the Fed by early 2020, ECB expected to keep dovish stance on monetary policy 	 The Euro regained some strength against the Dollar in the morning session as the EURUSD managed to break the 1.1140 resistance line it had encountered in previous sessions. The pair had been trading in a tight range of 7 pips in the Asian session trying to recover from the two-year lows of 1.1107 seen last Thursday (May 23). The push higher in the Euro has also coincided with cross-related buying EURGBP. $$$$ However, a lower than expected reading on German CPI can halt the Euro’s rebound as it would likely further embolden the dovish stance from the ECB next week. Inflation for the month of May is expected to come in at 1.6%, lower than last month’s 2%, as it is expected for inflation to slow down after the month in which Easter takes place on the back of the Easter seasonality. German states have been releasing their CPI figures for May throughout the morning before the National figure is released at 1200 GMT.  $$$$ Source: DailyFX, ForexLive $$$$ We could see the Dollar bulls regain some control throughout the day as continuing trade wars could see demand for the safe-haven dollar push the EURUSD lower. Focus will also shift towards US core inflation being released later today, as investor’s keep an eye out for signals that an increase in prices could lead to the Fed maintaining its patient stance.  $$$$ German 10-year bond yields are down to post-Brexit lows of -0.20% as slowing inflation expectations and stagnant growth prompt fears of a recessionary environment. And it is not just in the Eurozone where investors are worried, long-term yields have been falling around the world with some government bonds hitting their lowest levels in years. $$$$ Source: DailyFX, Thomson Reuters $$$$ When investors are concerned about the economy and equity markets they turn to government bonds because of their implied low risk. The purchase of bonds pushes bond prices higher which in turn leads to a fall in yields, the payment investors collect from their investment in bonds. Thus, falling bond yields can be seen as an indicator that a recessionary environment is coming, if not at least that investors’ concerns about the economic outlook are growing. $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters $$$$ Of a bigger concern is that the increase in demand for longer-term bonds has pushed longer-term yields below shorter-term yields. The current yield on a 10-year yield Treasury note yields stands at 2.16% whilst a 3-year yield Treasury note currently yields 2.37%. This is known as a yield curve inversion and is of a big concern to investors as they have preceded recessions in the past. In stable market conditions, investors would demand a higher yield on longer-term bonds as they seek for greater compensation for having their money tied up for longer periods of time.  $$$$ Source: DailyFX, Thomson Reuters $$$$ Worsening economic conditions and continuing trade wars between China and the US have dampened the economic outlook of the economy and markets are now signalling that they expect at least two rate cuts by the beginning of next year, despite the Fed announcing last week that they wish to keep rates unchanged for the foreseeable future. The next FOMC meeting is due to take place on June 18-19, and despite markets not pricing in a rate cut in June, they expect the funds rate to be cut in September. $$$$ Across the pond, the ECB is expected to meet next Thursday June 6, with recent remarks from ECB Board member Olli Rehn suggesting a continued dovish stance on monetary policy. Inflation in the Eurozone is expected to miss its 2% target for the next two years as forecasts show 1.3% for 2019, 1.5% for 2020 and 1.6% for 2021. A recent survey of 100 economists carried out by Reuters revealed that the ECB has no prospects of increasing interest rates throughout 2020. It comes on the back of ECB officials signalling that the Central Bank is willing to keep interest rates negative for as long as needed to ensure that the Eurozone economy avoids a recession.

Data for the month of May has come in better than expected but figures for the previous month have been revised lower.  $$$$ The release of the figures has had little effect on the Euro as traders remain focused on the results of the European Elections and the EU leaders’ summit to determine whether the next ECB policymaker will be more hawkish or dovish than Mario Draghi.  $$$$ The pair managed to recover slightly on Monday as the results of the European Elections showed that despite centre parties losing votes, these have not only gone to populists but also to pro-European parties like the Greens and Liberals, slightly easing concerns about the up-rise in Eurosceptic parties. Italy remains one of the main points of concern for the EU, as Matteo Salvini’s right-wing League party claimed victory by taking 34.3% of the votes. His position on EU Budget Limitations is expected to re-open the budget clashes with Brussels, leading to a widening of the spread between Italian and German bonds. $$$$ The beginning of the European session saw some support from the Euro despite worse than expected German consumer confidence figures released earlier. Both EURUSD and EURGBP were trading higher, with the latter pushing past 0.8835 and recovering most of the ground it had lost since the close n Friday. $$$$ The session ahead has little in terms of key economic releases from the Eurozone, the main pressure on EURUSD is expected this afternoon as US Consumer Confidence figures are released this afternoon, with an expected rise to 130 from 129.2. $$$$ DailyFX Calendar $$$$ The final figures for Euro-Zone Consumer Confidence in the month of May remained constant at -6.5 after being revised lower to -7.3 whilst the Eurozone Economic Confidence recovered to 105.1 beating expectations of 103.9. $$$$ The rise was led by both the Services and Industrial Confidence improving in the month of May. Services confidence was up to 12.2 from 11.8 and Industrial confidence recovered from -4.3 to -2.9. This figure asks for production expectations, meaning that a deterioration indicates a negative outlook for the future of the business spending and capital investment.  $$$$ IG Client Sentiment –.EURUSD: Retail trader data shows 57.8% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.37 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since May 15 when EURUSD traded near 1.12056; price has moved 0.2% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 14.4% lower than yesterday and 8.0% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 0.8% lower than yesterday and 7.7% lower from last week. $$$$ We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EURUSD prices may continue to fall.

US-German Yield Spread Falls, Potentially Benefiting EURUSD	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/05/30/US-German-Yield-Spread-Falls-Potentially-Benefiting-EURUSD.html	1559219400	 Safe-haven Government bonds are proving attractive to investors as they worry about a possible worldwide recession. $$$$ However, the spread – or difference in yield – between US Treasuries and German Bunds is falling, and that could help the Euro against the Dollar as it reduces the attraction of US assets compared with German assets to global investors. 	 Government bonds issued by top-rated countries like the US and Germany are proving attractive to global investors spooked by fears that the US-China trade war could weaken the world economy and perhaps even lead to recession. $$$$ However, in recent days, buying of US Treasuries has lowered the yield on them by more than demand for German debt has reduced the yield on Bunds. That means Treasuries are now relatively less attractive against Bunds than they were – a development that could help EURUSD as more global investors buy the Euros needed to acquire German debt rather than the Dollars needed to buy Treasuries. $$$$ Currently, 10-year Bund yields are close to their record lows while 10-year Treasury yields are not far from two-year lows. However, the yield spread has narrowed sharply as the following chart shows. $$$$ Source: Investing.com (you can click on it for a larger image) $$$$ A Brief History of Trade Wars $$$$ There are several caveats to this. First, US yields remain much higher than German yields so Treasuries remain more attractive than Bunds in absolute terms. Second, the return on Bunds remains negative – and indeed more negative than it was. Thirdly, the US Dollar is sometimes seen as a safe haven itself so the USD could benefit from the same risk aversion that is prompting the move from stocks to bonds. $$$$ Moreover, from a technical perspective, EURUSD remains in a downtrend and could fall further, as my colleague Justin McQueen points out here. $$$$ Nonetheless, at the margin, the latest move in the yield spread could at least slow its decline. $$$$ Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, at DailyFX we have many resources to help you: $$$$ --- Written by Martin Essex, Analyst and Editor $$$$ Feel free to contact me via the comments section below, via email at martin.essex@ig.com or on Twitter @MartinSEssex 
EURUSD Price Outlook: Still Looking to Fall Further	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/05/29/EURUSD-Price-Outlook-Still-Looking-to-Fall-Further-.html	1559116680	 EURUSD set to test recent one-year low.  $$$$ EURUSD technical set-up remains negative. 	 Q2 2019 EUR Forecast and USD Top Trading Opportunities $$$$ With little in the way of important Euro-Zone data this week, the EUR may well test the recent one-year low against the US dollar at just above 1.1100 and print yet another lower low. On the other side of the pair, the greenback is looking at some high-profile releases over the next couple of days and any better-than-expected prints may force EURUSD lower. Yesterday’s US consumer confidence release beat expectations with ease – 134.1 vs 130.0 exp and 129.2 prior - boosting the USD back towards its two-year peak. $$$$ Keep up to date with all key economic data and event releases via the DailyFX Economic Calendar $$$$ The US dollar remains firm despite US Treasury yields falling to lows not seen since September 2017. Lower government bond yields normally weaken the currency, however the USD continues to attract a safe-haven bid as risk appetite continues to wane. The 10-year UST currently yields 2.236%, down from 3.23% in September 2018. $$$$ The EURUSD chart remains bearish with an unbroken pattern of lower highs prominent since the start of January this year. The pair are now trading under all three moving averages, a bearish set-up, and a re-test of the recent 1.1107 low print remains likely. The CCI indictor shows the pair nearing oversold territory but it should be noted that EURUSD has been heavily oversold on five occasions this year, and twice very heavily. To the upside, the pair may struggle to break through congestion between 1.1176 and1.1216.  $$$$ Retail traders are 58.8% net-long EURUSD according to the latest IG Client Sentiment Data, a bearish contrarian indicator. However recent daily and weekly positional changes give us a stronger contrarian bearish bias. $$$$ We run several Trader Sentiment Webinars every week explaining how to use IG client sentiment data and positioning when looking at a trade set-up.

Mixed Eurozone Data Keeps EURUSD Subdued, Focus on Fed Chair Powell's Speech	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/06/04/Mixed-Eurozone-Data-Keeps-EURUSD-Subdued-Focus-on-Fed-Chair-Powells-Speech.html	1559642400	 Falling unemployment keeps the Euro from sliding despite falling inflation. $$$$ EURUSD remains subdued ahead of Powell’s commentary on Fed policy. $$$$ TLTROs to be a key point to look out for at the ECB’s monetary meeting on Thursday. 	 The EURUSD pushed above the 1.1245 handle at the end of Monday’s session as disappointing ISM US data sent the dollar lower, before trading in a 17-pip range during the overnight session. The pair headed higher again at the open of the European session, pushing the it past 1.1270 before it reversed in anticipation of Eurozone inflation and unemployment figures being released today. Mixed data provided a small push for the Euro before EURUSD settled around 1.1246. $$$$ Preliminary Eurozone Headline inflation grew by 1.2% in the month of May (exp. 1.3%) down from 1.7% in the previous month and Eurozone Core inflation grew 0.8% in May (exp. 0.9%), down from 1.3% in the previous month. The figure is in line with other inflation releases seen last week in the Eurozone, with drops in Germany, Spain and France, signalling that underlying price pressures are falling. $$$$ Despite falling inflation, unemployment figures provided some relief as the unemployment rate fell to 7.6% in the month of May, despite expectations of the rate to remain the same as last month’s reading of 7.7%. Unemployment has been the key outlier around the globe in the face of a global economic slowdown as many monetary policies setting bodies, including the RBA and the Fed, have focused on improving employment to remain less dovish than markets expectations. But there have been caution signs as last week saw Germany’s unemployment rose for the first time since 2013, as 60,000 more people were considered unemployed in the month of May. $$$$ DailyFX Economic Calendar $$$$ A data-heavy week lies ahead for both the Euro and the US dollar. German, French and Eurozone PMIs will be released on Wednesday. Despite expectations for the figures to be little changed from the previous month, worse than expected numbers could send the Euro lower ahead of the ECB’s rate meeting on Thursday, the key event for the Euro this week. Even though it is expected that the Central Bank will keep rates unchanged at -0.4%, the focus will be on how dovish they remain and whether the Eurozone needs to consider additional monetary stimulus, especially as the ECB is currently looking for a new President to replace Mario Draghi. A key point to look out for in Thursday’s meeting is for any mention on the terms of the new round of TLTROs for the Eurozone banks. $$$$ On the US dollar side, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to give his outlook on the Fed policy in an event taking place today in Chicago, where a more dovish stance could push the USD lower against other major currencies, as markets are now pricing in at least two 0.25% US interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Part of the downgrade in expectations on the future of the US economy is that yield curves have inverted signalling that a recession may be nearing. Of key importance to the Fed’s decision on rates will be non-farm payrolls and wages figures to be released on Friday. $$$$ Hawkish vs Dovish: How Monetary Policy Affects FX Trading – David Bradfield, Markets Writer $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ KEY TRADING RESOURCES: $$$$ --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst

The ECB could serve as the next catalyst that sparks additional forex volatility with the world’s largest central bank scheduled to publish its latest monetary policy decision Thursday at 11:45 GMT. Although the policy interest rate is expected to be left unchanged according to overnight swaps pricing, commentary from ECB President Mario Draghi subsequent to the policy statement release looks to provide markets with clues to the ECB’s next move.  $$$$ The Euro has ascended steadily against a depreciating US Dollar with the latest topside breakout in spot EURUSD testing resistance near the 1.1300 handle. The 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level from the year-to-date high and low aligns with upper bound of the 1-standard deviation implied trading range which may prove difficult for spot prices to overcome. Moreover, resistance from the longer-term bearish downtrend line formed by the series of lower highs recorded throughout 2019 threatens to keep EURUSD upside at bay – an increasingly dovish message communicated by the ECB tomorrow would likely reignite the drift lower.  $$$$ Yet, EURUSD downside could be limited by broader weakness experienced by the greenback as rate traders price in growing chances that the Federal Reserve cuts rates this year. The 1.1200 price level has served as an area of confluence in the past and spot rates might find support here along with the upward sloping EMAs and 23.6 percent Fib. Although, it is noteworthy that EURUSD risk reversals recently flipped to positive as forex traders seek protection against rising spot prices as opposed to dropping rates. This could indicate a bullish bias for spot EURUSD as demand for call options outweighs that for puts.  $$$$ - Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX $$$$ - Follow @RichDvorakFX on Twitter

The pair passed the 1.1300 handle for the first time since April 18 but slipped back shortly after, settling around 1.1227 where it traded in a tight 12-pip range in the overnight session. $$$$ EURGBP showed some resilience to the anticipation of the ECB meeting in the morning session as Brexit and weakening UK macroeconomic data continue to dampen Sterling’s ability to push higher. GBP failed to take advantage of EUR bears to bring the pair down from highs of 0.8900 recorded on Tuesday, last seen in the month of January at the height of Brexit deal voting turmoil. The pair is currently trading around 0.8860. The contraction experienced in the UK manufacturing industry kept the composites PMI below expectations for the month of May, despite a slight improvement in services PMI. $$$$ Final GDP figures confirm that the Eurozone managed to grow 0.4% in the first quarter of the year, despite continuing political and economic uncertainty dampening growth prospects around the globe. On top of that, employment managed to stay strong as the first quarter of the year saw a growth in employment of 0.3% for the bloc, further supported by the fall in unemployment that was revealed on Tuesday, where the unemployment rate fell from 7.7% to 7.6% in the month of April. Household consumption for the first quarter of the year was 0.5% up from 0.3% in the previous quarter but missing expectations of 0.6%. $$$$ Services PMIs remained mostly above expectations for the month of May, keeping the Eurozone Composite PMI in expansion at 51.8 (Exp. 51.6) despite growing concerns about the manufacturing industry. $$$$ Despite a positive note from employment and growth, investors remain weary as inflation continues to fall despite the ECB’s efforts to push prices higher by increasing the money supply in the market. Headline inflation in the Eurozone fell to 1.2% YoY in the month of May, down from 1.7% in the previous month and below expectations of 1.3%, with core inflation dropping to 0.8% YoY. The 5y5y inflation swap, a measure of euro-area inflation expectations, has fallen to its weakest level since 2016. $$$$ Hawkish vs Dovish: How Monetary Policy Affects FX Trading – David Bradfield, Markets Writer $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ KEY TRADING RESOURCES: $$$$ --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst

However, keep in mind that this is just the ECB catching up with market pricing, given that money markets have already priced out the likelihood that the ECB would shift interest rates in 2019 and in fact markets are pricing in interest rate cuts. Not only this, while the ECB signal that rates will remain at current level through H1 2020, Fed Fund futures are pricing in 100bps worth of cuts from the Fed in that time.  $$$$ TLTRO 3 Details Show Favourable Lending Conditions $$$$ The ECB noted that TLTRO 3 will be guided from as low as -0.3%, which is 10bps above the deposit rate for those banks who are exceeding their lending targets, while other banks would see a rate of 0.1%, which is 10bps above the main refinancing rate. Consequently, this is slightly more favourable for bank lending than had been previously expected which was -0.2%-0%, thus helping the Euro find a bid to session highs of 1.1272.  $$$$ EURUSD PRICE CHART: 1-Minutes Time Frame (Intra-day) $$$$ For a more in-depth analysis on EUR, check out the Q2 Forecast for EUR $$$$ --- Written by Justin McQueen, Market Analyst $$$$ To contact Justin, email him at Justin.mcqueen@ig.com $$$$ Follow Justin on Twitter @JMcQueenFX

Q2 2019 EUR Forecast and USD Top Trading Opportunities $$$$ Keep up to date with all key economic data and event releases via the DailyFX Economic Calendar $$$$ The latest market indicator of Euro-Zone inflation expectations – the 5-yr/5-yr inflation-linked swap rate – today printed a new all-time low at 1.165%. The indicator measures inflation expectation over a five-year period starting five years from now. This will be a major headache for the ECB whose remit is to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium-term. $$$$ This reading is closely monitored by the ECB and the recent fall in expectations will only increase pressure on the central bank to loosen monetary conditions further – rate cuts, more quantitative easing – to boost price pressures in the single-block. The ECB halted the QE 2 at the end of 2018, apart from coupon and repayment reinvestments, and the central bank is likely in the months ahead to admit that more QE is necessary. The Euro-Zone benchmark (10-yr German Bund) currently trades at -0.265%, while the 20-year Bund offers a paltry 12.5 basis points of yield, highlighting the view that interest rates are going to stay very low for a long time.  $$$$ EURUSD remains around 1.5 cents away from making a fresh two-year low if it breaks the May 23 nadir at 1.1107. The pair’s upside is currently being halted by the 200-day moving average which has held firm over the last week with the level broken but not closed above. EURUSD downside is being tempered by a weak US dollar with markets fully expecting at least two 0.25% interest rate cuts this year, cutting the attractiveness of the US dollar. $$$$ EURUSD Price Outlook Cloudy – ECB’s Rehn Talks Rate Cuts and More QE $$$$ Retail traders are 45.8% net-long EURUSD according to the latest IG Client Sentiment Data, a bullish contrarian indicator.

EURUSD Price Outlook Cloudy - ECB's Rehn Talks Rate Cuts and More QE	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/06/11/EURUSD-Outlook-Cloudy-ECBs-Rehn-Talks-Rate-Cuts-and-More-QE.html	1560249000	 ECB primed to intervene if economic weakness continues.  $$$$ EURUSD unable to break higher, despite US dollar weakness.  	 Q2 2019 EUR Forecast and USD Top Trading Opportunities $$$$ Keep up to date with all key economic data and event releases via the DailyFX Economic Calendar $$$$ Bank of Finland governor and ECB governing council member Olli Rehn is back out on the wires Tuesday reiterating that the ECB stands ready to act, using all tools available, to counter the ongoing economic weakness and stubbornly low inflation in the Euro-Zone. Rehn, a candidate for the upcoming ECB President’s role, said that the central bank is ‘determined to act and stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate’. He also noted that ‘external risks to the Euro-Area won’t fade in the near future’. $$$$ These instruments include stronger forward guidance, cutting interest rates further, potential changes to bank reserve rates and re-starting quantitative easing (QE). The ECB ended the last QE program at the end of 2018 and a swift re-introduction of the program would highlight the lack of effect the four-year, EUR2.6 trillion+ bond buying program has had on the economy. Growth remains tepid, while inflation expectations are near record lows. $$$$ EURUSD price action is currently predicated on US dollar more, more than Euro strength. Post last Thursday’s ECB meeting – where the governing council officially push rates lower for longer – EURUSD touched a peak just under 1.1350 before fading back to its current quote around 1.1318. The pair traded at a 2019 high of 1.1571 on January 10 before sliding lower over the course of 2019. EURUSD remains in overbought territory, using the CCI indicator, and its upside is currently blocked by the 200-day moving average, a long-term indicator that has held firm all the way back to May 2018.  $$$$ EURUSD Price – Bulls Clash with Technical Resistance $$$$ Retail traders are 43.8% net-long EURUSD according to the latest IG Client Sentiment Data, a bullish contrarian indicator.

DAX 30 Price Surges to Resistance, Posts Biggest Gain in 5 Months	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/06/18/DAX-30-Price-Surges-to-Resistance-Posts-Biggest-Gain-in-5-Months.html	1560893400	 The DAX 30 soared to 12,330 – the 61.8% Fib level from January 2018 highs to December 2018 lows $$$$ The fundamental and technical landscape offers a staging ground from which the DAX can attack May highs  $$$$ Retail traders are unconvinced of the Index’s strength and remain net-short. View our IG Client Sentiment data and learn how to incorporate it into your trading with one of our webinars 	 The German DAX 30 posted its best intraday performance since mid-January on the back of commentary from the European Central Bank. The potential to pursue further stimulus pressured EURUSD but bolstered the DAX which had been consolidating in the days prior.  $$$$ Tangentially, President Trump announced that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping would meet at the G20 Summit in Japan to discuss trade. The meeting presents an opportunity for the two leaders to work toward a deal, but also breaks the deadlock in trade talks between the two nations. Together, loose monetary policy out of the ECB and the prospect of a trade war breakthrough pushed the DAX to 12,330. The 2.03% climb was the largest single-day gain for the Index since January 18 when it rose 2.63%. $$$$ After passing through trendline resistance from early February, the DAX drove through subsequent Fibonacci resistance around 12,295 before it eventually stalled out beneath another point of Fib resistance around 12,362. The German equity index now enjoys a series of nearby technical levels which it can look to for support. Further, the tailwind offered by the ECB’s potential to pursue further easing could work in tandem to spur the DAX to test May highs around 12,467. The area will pose the next significant point of technical resistance. Should it be surpassed, secondary resistance will come into play – marked by the highs from August – around 12,700. $$$$ Retail traders, however, are not convinced. Retail trader data shows 29.6% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 2.38 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-short since June 4 when the DAX traded near 11778.2; price has moved 4.7% higher since then. The number of traders net-long is 40.8% lower than yesterday and 22.1% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 11.5% higher than yesterday and 4.4% lower from last week. $$$$ We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests the DAX may continue to rise. Traders are further net-short than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger bullish contrarian bias for the DAX 30. With the technical, fundamental and retail trader sentiment signals aligned, the DAX looks primed to continue its recent strength.  $$$$ --Written by Peter Hanks, Junior Analyst for DailyFX.com $$$$ Contact and follow Peter on Twitter @PeterHanksFX $$$$ Read more:AUDUSD & Nasdaq 100 Price Outlook: Huawei Offers Opportunity

The primary factors driving the fall in expected USD volatility include ‘constructive’ US China trade talks and backward-looking inflation data. As next week approaches, however, several risks still loom that could give currency volatility another jolt.  $$$$ EURUSD is highlighted ahead of the approaching May 18 deadline for US President Trump to announce his decision to raise tariffs on auto imports. Also, the ZEW Survey of Expectations looks to provide a glimpse into the latest Eurozone sentiment readings on Tuesday while EU GDP will take the spotlight during Wednesday’s session. $$$$ While EURUSD ripped above its bearish trend after healthy advances the last two days, the reversal higher could be echoed if Eurozone economic data keeps surprising to the upside. But, if US President Trump does decide to levy tariffs on EU auto exports, the news will likely weigh negatively on the Euro and reverse recent EURUSD gains.  $$$$ The Australian Dollar also looks ripe for potential price action next week with Aussie jobs data on deck. Now in the shadows of the RBNZ rate cut decision, the RBA could be set in the hot seat to follow suit – particularly if Australia employment numbers disappoint on Thursday.  $$$$ Furthermore, another escalation in tension over the US China trade war could drag AUDUSD lower. Economic headwinds in China from US tariffs may translate into AUDUSD weakness considering Australia relies heavily on trade with the Chinese.  $$$$ That being said, spot AUDUSD is estimated to trade between 0.6937 and 0.7061 as calculated from the currency pair’s 1-week implied volatility of 7.6 percent with a 68 percent statistical probability.  $$$$ Near-side technical support eyes the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level formed by the intraday low recorded during the JPY flash crash at the beginning of the year and high on January 31. On the other hand, technical resistance is posed by the 50 percent retracement line and bearish downtrend resistance.  $$$$ - Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX $$$$ - Follow @RichDvorakFX on Twitter

EURUSD awaits key US data to consolidate a direction
$$$$
Eurozone inflation moves higher
"	"
The Euro failed to regain support from the release of Eurozone CPI figures after trading softer throughout most of the Asian session. EURUSD’s downtrend continued after figures revealed annual inflation rate in the Euro area increased to 1.7% in April, up from 1.4% in March, slightly higher than the 1.6% expected. Core inflation, which excludes volatile prices of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, and is the figure the ECB uses for its policy decision, was 1.2% in April (Expt. 1.0%).
$$$$
But despite better than expected inflation figures providing potential for a short rebound, EURUSD continues to trade near year-lows registered earlier in the week on the back of a less-dovish stance from the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday May 1. The pair is still trading below the 1.12 handle as traders wait for nonfarm payrolls figures, due to be released at 13.30, to consolidate a direction. A stronger than expected jobs report has the potential to reignite the prevailing EURUSD downtrend.

It is common for inflation to increase in the month that Easter holidays take place, especially if they fall towards the end of the month, as an increase in demand for package holidays, restaurants and hotels pushes prices higher. But keeping in mind that the Easter effect is a seasonality, inflation figures for the following months need to continue on the upside for the ECB to shift to a more hawkish stance.
$$$$
As a recap of recent Eurozone data, manufacturing PMI figures released yesterday showed that figures for Spain, Italy and France were improving whilst Germany figures disappointed. Overall European Manufacturing PMI was revised upward from 47.8 to 47.9 in April, showing a small recovery from its 80-month low of 44.1 recorded in March. European CPI released today is in line with German CPI figures released on Tuesday Apr 30, showing inflation for the month of April beat expectations by 0.5 percentage points, from 1.5% expected to 2%.

EURUSD Fails to Break Higher After EU Economic Forecast Downgrades	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/05/07/EURUSD-Fails-to-Break-Higher-After-EU-Economic-Forecast-Downgrades-.html	1557239400	 EURUSD Remains USD-Sensitive $$$$ EU Growth is Downgraded Amid Tightening Global Financial Conditions $$$$ Italy’s Budget Deficit Continues Due to a Weak Labour Market 	 DailyFX Q2 Euro Forecast $$$$ After recovering most of its ground over the weekend, the EURUSD was trading softer, and below the 1.12 handle, during the European morning session, remaining mostly flat even after the EU’s Spring Economic Forecast was released. The fact is that, despite improving regional data released last week, the EURUSD struggled to find upside momentum, only managing a slight improvement after mixed US jobs data lead to US dollar weakness on Friday.  $$$$ As the pair’s direction continues to be USD-dominant, the focus will shift towards the USD Consumer Price Index figure which will be released on Friday May 10. Forecasts show that US CPI is expected to have increased in April, mostly due to an increase in oil prices since the beginning of the year. $$$$ Euro Weekly Price Outlook: EUR/USD Recovery Could be Short Lived – Michael Boutros, Technical Strategist $$$$ The bottom line is that the Eurozone continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate. The EU’s GDP is expected to grow at 1.4% in 2019 and 1.6%% in 2020, a downward revision from the winter forecast of 1.5% and 1.7% respectively. Consumer Price Inflation has picked up since the beginning of the year, as CPI in April was 1.7%, up from 1.4% in the previous month and beating forecasts of 1.6%. Despite the increase in prices most likely being influenced by the “Easter Bunny effect”, fundamentals show that the labour market is strong, and wages are increasing.  $$$$ EU GDP/Inflation Forecast change $$$$ The focus has again shifted towards Italy, which last week emerged from a technical recession, as the country’s budget deficit is expected to increase to 2.5% of GDP, above the 2% target that was agreed with Brussels in December. After two consecutive quarters with negative growth at the end of 2018, Italy’s GDP for the first quarter of 2019 has grown by 0.2%, providing some relief for the Eurozone economy. But as Rome is reluctant to implement policies to reduce its deficit, the EU could impose an Excessive Deficit Procedure leading to Italy being fined, which could see Euroscepticism rise within the country. $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ DailyFX Economic Calendar $$$$ IG Client Sentiment – Retail trader data shows 67.4% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.07 to 1.

Euro Rebound is Halted by Worse Than Expected German Manufacturing PMI	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/05/02/Euro-Rebound-is-Halted-by-Worse-Than-Expected-Germany-Manufacturing-PMI.html	1556785800	"
EURUSD Fails to Rebound from Yesterday’s Losses
$$$$
Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Data
"	"
The Euro was regaining some support at the beginning of the morning session as an influx of European manufacturing PMIs (Spain, Italy & France) were coming in better than expected, but a downward revision for Germany halted its uptrend leaving the pair trading around the 1.1200 handle.
$$$$
The focus for EURUSD traders will now shift towards tomorrow’s Eurozone Consumer Price Index, which may come in better than expected following the sizeable lift in German inflation figures (economic calendar). 
$$$$
DailyFX Q2 Euro Forecast
$$$$
Eurozone manufacturing PMI final figures for April came in better than expected at 47.9 (Exp. 47.8), up from 47.5 in March, seeing a small rebound after continuing declines since July 2018. The figure is the second lowest since April 2013 and as unemployment and growth remained stagnant, its influence on the ECB’s next rate decision is likely to be minimum.
$$$$
Spain managed a second month of expansion as April manufacturing PMI was 51.8, whilst Italy managed to beat expectation of 47.7, with the final figure coming in at 49.1. France’s manufacturing services rose to 50 in the month of April, beating expectations of a contraction in the industry.
$$$$
German manufacturing PMI final figures for April had been revised down to 44.4 from 44.5, while this is slightly up from the 80-month low of 44.1 in March, this continues to show that the manufacturing sector remains very much in contraction territory. This is believed to be driven mostly by the weaker demand across the automotive sector leading to a steep decline in new export orders.
$$$$
The disappointing figure comes after the recent German CPI for April released earlier this week, which showed that headline inflation jumped to 2% above expectations of 1.5%. The increase is said to be due to higher prices for energy and services, with the latter most likely experiencing a boost from the Easter holiday period. Nonetheless, a decrease in unemployment figures show that the uptrend in inflation may continue in the following months.

Alongside a few key tech companies, US retailers have highlighted the adverse impact from a strong US Dollar in their first quarter earnings. According to FactSet, concerns around a strong Dollar have only increased from the quarter prior, and the trend could be set to continue if Greenback strength persists. 
$$$$
Source: FactSet
$$$$
At the company level, Nike is one retailer that has highlighted headwinds due to foreign exchange rates. “It is important to note that we expect roughly 6 points of FX headwindsin Q4 which would result in low single-digit reported revenue growth. As you may recall in Q4 of last year, we delivered 8% currency-neutral revenue growth with 13% reported revenue growth” Nike CFO Andy Campion said on their March 21, third quarter earnings call. 
$$$$
While Nike warned of an FX headwind as their 2019 fiscal year concludes, the 2020 outlook was more optimistic. “We also see the disparity between currency-neutral and reported revenue growth peaking in Q4 before narrowing significantly as we enter fiscal year 2020 based on current FX rates. As a result, we currently expect the FX headwind on reported revenue to largely dissipate as we enter fiscal year 2020” Mr. Campion continued. Interestingly, Nike’s FX outlook contrasts with that of Google’s which warned of a stronger Dollar in the coming months.
$$$$
Elsewhere, Hanes Brands had similar findings on the state of FX. “Adverse foreign currency exchange rates for the year are expected to reduce net sales as reported by approximately $115 million compared with last year, up from previous expectations of approximately $60 million” read a company filing of their first quarter earnings – released today. Despite the headwind, Hanes was able to deliver results above expectations – but saw its stock price falter after it revealed a bad debt charge from Heritage Sportswear.
$$$$
Like Nike and Hanes, VF Corporation, which owns US brands like Vans, the North Face and Timberland also noted a strong Dollar. In their most recent earnings report, VF financial statements reveal the company’s profit was reduced by $681,000 due to currency headwinds – compared to a profit of $737,000 in the year prior. While the $1.5 million swing is unlikely to make or break VF Corporation, it demonstrates the impact of Dollar strength on corporate profits over time. 
$$$$
Unlike FX, US corporations seem to be coming to terms with tariffs and trade wars. Compared to 4Q 2018, fewer firms have thus far warned of adverse impacts from the ongoing economic conflicts. On Thursday, conflicting statements came out of official Chinese media and the Commerce Department of the United States. While the former said the talks may have reached an impasse, the latter was optimistic a deal was near. The two sides will meet again in Washington next week for further talks. 
$$$$
With May’s FOMC decision in the rearview, it will now look to Friday’s release of US Non-Farm Payroll data for guidance. As for the S&P 500, a key technical break and a neutral Fed could mark troubled times ahead. For a deeper look at the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 join my equity webinar on Friday.

Although expected EURUSD price action has fallen slightly with GDP data in the rearview mirror, overnight implied volatility remains elevated with Eurozone inflation and US nonfarm payrolls slated for release tomorrow 
$$$$
Spot EURUSD trades back below the 1.12 handle following a relatively hawkish Fed yesterday, but upcoming data could help the Euro rebound back above this technical level or reinforce the dollar’s dominance

EURUSD overnight implied volatility appears relatively high at 6.17 percent ahead of Eurozone inflation and US nonfarm payroll data due for release tomorrow. This compares to the average of 4.93 percent during April and 5.69 percent year-to-date.
$$$$
Spot EURUSD trades below the 1.12 handle once again after the latest Fed meeting revealed a less-dovish tilt which casted a shadow over bullish prospects for this currency pair. With GDP data, FOMC and Powell presser risk now in the rearview mirror, forex traders will likely turn to high-impact economic indicators expected during Friday’s session to reassess positioning biases. 
$$$$
Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets. 
$$$$
Eurozone year-over-year core CPI for April is forecasted to cross the wires at 1.0 percent. If this inflation measure undershoots estimates, EURUSD could slide further seeing that a soft number would likely underpin the ECB’s easing bias. On the other hand, a better than expected reading could help the Euro recover from its recent downside.
$$$$
As for the greenback, another robust US jobs report has potential of reigniting the long-prevailing EURUSD downtrend. Conversely, a materially worse-than-expected number could jeopardize the dollar’s recent advance.   
$$$$
Other economic indicators worth watching out of the US included the change in unemployment rate, average hourly earnings and the ISM Services Index. 
$$$$
Judging by EURUSD overnight implied volatility, forex traders might expect the currency pair to trade between 1.1145 and 1.1217 with a 68 percent statistical probability. However, bearish technical indicators could pose headwinds to EURUSD upside. 
$$$$
For example, support-turned-resistance at the 1.12 handle and the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the high and low recorded on March 20 and April 26 respectively might hinder spot prices from advancing.

The year-over-year headline CPI number for April crossed the tape at 2.0 percent versus Bloomberg’s median consensus of 2.1 percent.  $$$$ In the follow-up press conference to the Fed meeting last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that tepid inflation was ‘transitory’ which initially boosted the greenback as markets subsequently reduced odds of an interest rate cut.  $$$$ Consequently, this morning’s data appears to have solidified EURUSD’s rebound off support at the 1.12 handle following the rip higher in spot prices which briefly eclipsed the 1.1250 level. The recent advance looks like EURUSD has broke above its short-term downtrend resistance formed by the series of lower highs illustrated above.  $$$$ Further gains in EURUSD could be limited, however, as the 1.1250 price could serve as resistance. This area also aligns with the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement line drawn from April’s high and low.  $$$$ Taking a look at the EURUSD weekly chart, the area of confluence between 1.12-1.15 and prevailing downtrend appears more prominent. Spot EURUSD is currently teetering around support at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the low and high recorded in January 2017 and February 2018 respectively, but downtrend resistance is close in sight. $$$$ While better-than-expected data out of the EU and muted US inflation has bolstered EURUSD as of late, forex traders will likely turn their focus to the decision on whether or not President Trump will raise auto tariffs by the Commerce Department's deadline assigned to Trump roughly 3 months ago. The official deadline for the Section 232 review process of auto imports is May 18, but a decision could be announced anytime before that cutoff.  $$$$ Slapping tariffs on EU auto exports to the US would likely harm Eurozone economic growth - particularly the likes of Germany - considering the US was the largest destination for EU auto exports last year. Therefore, if US President Trump ends up levying tariffs on EU aus in a sweeping extension of the trade war, EURUSD has potential of coming under renewed downward pressure.  $$$$ - Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX $$$$ - Follow @RichDvorakFX on Twitter 
Euro Price Outlook Worsens as Italian Politics Move Into Focus	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/05/15/Euro-Price-Outlook-Worsens-as-Italian-Politics-Move-Into-Focus.html	1557932400	 A threat by the leader of Italy’s right-wing League to break the EU’s fiscal rules could damage the Euro. $$$$ For now at least, traders will likely pay more attention to the sparring in Italy than to some modestly positive economic data from the Eurozone. 	 A call by Matteo Salvini, who leads the right-wing League party in Italy, for the Italian government to be ready to break the EU’s debt ceiling of 3% of GDP and raise the country’s debt to 140% of GDP if necessary could undermine the Euro in the days ahead. $$$$ Salvini, who is also one of Italy’s deputy prime ministers, is currently campaigning for the European Parliament elections on May 26 and was immediately criticized by Luigi Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. $$$$ The two parties are currently coalition partners but Di Maio, who is deputy prime minister too, said Salvini was being “pretty irresponsible” to create market tensions by “shooting off” about increasing the country’s already high debt. $$$$ If this sparring continues, it could well weaken the Euro despite some positive Eurozone data released Wednesday and reports that US President Donald Trump is expected to delay a decision on tariffs on imported cars and parts by up to six months that lifted EURUSD late in the European day. $$$$ Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image) $$$$ You can find a technical view on the outlook for the Euro here $$$$ In Germany, flash first-quarter GDP data released Wednesday showed a 0.4% increase quarter/quarter after a flat reading in the previous quarter – although year/year figures showed a drop in growth to 0.6% from 0.9%. As for the Eurozone as a whole, data released later revealed that growth doubled to 0.4% quarter/quarter and was stable at 1.2% year/year. $$$$ This more optimistic economic data will likely be ignored though as risk appetite remains poor, prompting money to flow into safe havens such as German government bonds. Bund yields were lower in almost all maturities Wednesday, with the 10-year yield hitting its lowest level since September 2016 before rallying on the auto tariffs news. $$$$ Find out here how the Euro was affected by the last Eurozone debt crisis and how recent developments look worryingly similar $$$$ Whether you are a new or an experienced trader, at DailyFX we have many resources to help you: $$$$ --- Written by Martin Essex, Analyst and Editor $$$$ Feel free to contact me via the comments section below, via email at martin.essex@ig.com or on Twitter @MartinSEssex 
EURUSD Muted Despite Negative Economic Outlook, Focus on Euro-zone GDP	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/05/14/EURUSD-Muted-Despite-Negative-Economic-Outlook-Focus-on-Euro-zone-GDP.html	1557826200	 UK jobs data below expectations but unemployment at its lowest in 44 years $$$$ Mixed economic sentiment provides little direction as EURUSD traders remain focused on trade war developments 	 IG Client Sentiment $$$$ EURUSD saw some muted downward pressure as the ZEW Economic Sentiment figures revealed a negative outlook on the future growth of Germany and the Eurozone amid the recent escalation in trade wars between the US and China. Consequently, this has halted the recent upside in the pair, which had been supported from the depreciation in the Dollar following the latest trade war developments. $$$$ Meanwhile, Sterling continued its macroeconomic data “ignorance” as GBPUSD and EURGBP remained little changed after slightly disappointing UK jobs data was released.  $$$$ The UK economy added 99k jobs in the 3 months to March, down from the 179k added during the previous period, and below expectations of 141k. Average weekly earnings has dropped to 3.2% from 3.5% in March, again below expectations of 3.4%. The employment rate in March was 76.1%, the joint-highest level on record. Additionally, unemployment rate was 3.8%, its lowest levels since December 1974. $$$$ The effect of economic releases on Sterling has been muted in recent weeks as investors focus on Brexit and UK politics developments for any guidance. $$$$ Despite current sentiment in Germany being better than expected, the ZEW Economic Sentiment for the month of May was -2.1 for Germany, down from 3.1 the previous month and below expectations of 5. The sentiment was -1.6 for the Euro-zone, a drop from last month’s 4.5, and way below its long-term average of 22.4. This figuremeasures the outlook on the economy in the next 6 months, with a value above 0 indicating a positive outlook on the economy and a value below 0 a negative outlook on the economy.  $$$$ Recent trade developments were expected to have a negative effect on business sentiment in export-heavy Germany and the figure is not surprising for the Euro-zone as the EU downgraded its growth forecasts in last week’s economic forecast. Slower growth in Germany has now been added to the top risks that the Euro-zone faces behind Brexit and US-China trade wars. $$$$ IG Client Sentiment – Retail trader data shows 50.8% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.03 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 2.8% higher than yesterday and 9.6% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 1.8% lower than yesterday and 26.7% higher from last week. We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EURUSD prices may continue to fall. Traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger EURUSD-bearish contrarian trading bias. $$$$ Webinar: Trader's Toolbox: How to Identify Trends with Trader Sentiment – Jeremy Wagner $$$$ Recommended Reading  $$$$ GBP Volatility Likely as Leadership Challenge to May Comes Closer – Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst $$$$ Eurozone Debt Crisis: How to Trade Future Disasters – Martin Essex, MSTA, Analyst and Editor $$$$ KEY TRADING RESOURCES: $$$$ --- Written by Daniela Sabin Hathorn, Junior Analyst

European Parliament elections take place this week, beginning Thursday and ending Sunday, with the results likely to confirm the rise of populism and Euro-skepticism.

A second is that price volatility remains low and the elections look unlikely to boost it. $$$$ However, investors will have time to analyze the election outcome thoroughly between the results Sunday and the opening of markets Monday – particularly necessary as the results will be clouded by national concerns in each EU country, with the debate centering on Brexit in the UK, for example. Still, looking further ahead, a good showing by far-right political parties will likely raise doubts again about the stability of the EU. $$$$ There could also be a power vacuum as a move away from center-right and center-left politicians leaves whichever party wins the most seats having to rely on resurgent Green parties for a majority. $$$$ From a long-term technical perspective, the downtrend that began eight months ago remains in place and a further decline to 1.10 looks possible.

Currency Volatility: EUR/USD and AUD/JPY in Focus	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/05/18/currency-volatility-eur-usd-aud-jpy-in-focus.html	1558126800	 1-week implied volatility for major forex pairs looks eerily low $$$$ Ongoing trade war uncertainty, monetary policy risk, and high-impact economic data highlights EURUSD and AUDJPY next week $$$$ Interested in learning more about forex market volatility? Check out this article on the Most Volatile Currency Pairs 	 Currency volatility is expected to be relatively muted next week according to implied volatility measures derived from 1-week forex option contracts. In fact, DXY US Dollar Index 1-week implied volatility of 5.32 percent is the fourth lowest reading on a Friday all year. This is quite surprising considering the latest flareup in risk trends with Brexit talks stalling, the reignition of the US China trade war, and intensifying speculation surrounding global monetary policy. $$$$ USD currency volatility appears to be trending higher, however, and forex price action has potential to receive a jolt from the Fed minutes due Wednesday at 18:00 GMT which will detail the April 30 – May 1 FOMC meeting. Market participants will likely parse the text for additional insight on the US central bank’s relatively hawkish or dovish leaning which will likely be reflected by overnight indexed swaps pricing.  $$$$ The futures market is currently putting a 47.3 percent probability on the Fed cutting its policy interest rate by its September meeting, which is up from 31.7 percent last Friday.  $$$$ Although, prior to the FOMC minutes release, it will be important to keep tabs on ECB President Mario Draghi who give a speech in Frankfurt at 7:00 GMT Wednesday on Eurozone economic developments and monetary policy. As such, EUR/USD will be particularly interesting to watch next week.  $$$$ According to IG client positioning data, 55.1 percent of EUR/USD traders are net-long with the ratio of longs to shorts at 1.23 to 1 headed into the weekend. In addition, the number of traders net long is 15.2 percent higher compared to last Friday.  $$$$ As risk trends appear to be resurfacing, AUD/JPY will be another currency pair worth watching next. With the recent shift lower in AUD/JPY price action, relatively risky currencies have generally been underperforming their safe-haven counterparts.  $$$$ This has led to the unwinding of the carry trade which has put additional downward pressure on spot AUD/JPY. Escalating risks stemming from the US China trade war threatens more downside in the AUD/JPY as market uncertainty – and volatility – looks to keep Japanese Yen bulls in charge of price action.  $$$$ Furthermore, the risk that a possible RBA rate cut could be hinted at by Governor Lowe who is set to speak in Brisbane on Tuesday at 2:15 GMT also threatens AUD/JPY next week. Also, the OECD is expected to publish its updated Global Economic Outlook report later on Tuesday at 9:00 GMT which has the potential to weigh heavily on the market’s overall appetite for risk.  $$$$ AUD/JPY client positioning data from IG indicates that a staggering 80.2 percent of traders remain net-long resulting in a long-to-short ratio of 4.05 to 1. Moreover, the number of traders net-long is 26.6 percent higher compared to last week.  $$$$ Taking a contrarian view on this trader sentiment data, spot AUD/JPY may continue to fall. That being said, with 1-week implied volatility of 9.68 percent, AUD/JPY traders might expect spot prices to gyrate between 74.755 and 76.469 over the next 5 trading days with a 68 percent statistical probability.  $$$$ - Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX $$$$ - Follow @RichDvorakFX on Twitter

According to the Financial Times latest poll, the European People’s Party coupled with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats look set to lose their combined majority. If polls are indicative of future results, EUR price weakness may persist if the rise of populism and Euroscepticism is confirmed.  $$$$ Unsurprisingly, rising implied volatility measures derived from EURUSD, EURGBP, and EURJPY forex options pricing suggests Euro traders brace for volatility ahead of EU parliamentary election results.  $$$$ EURUSD is estimated to trade between 1.1215 and 1.1099 with a 68 percent statistical probability over the next week according to 1-week implied volatility of 4.43 percent. The upper bound of the 1-standard deviation band surrounding spot prices aligns closely with technical resistance posed by the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level from its year-to-date high and low in addition to the bearish downtrend line around the 1.12 handle.  $$$$ This price level has recently served as a major area of confluence and could be retested if the European People’s Party and Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats can retain majority in Parliament. On the contrary, the loss of seats could push EURUSD to target 2019 lows near the 1.11 handle.  $$$$ EURGBP has been on a 16-day tear of consecutive gains in response to the latest Brexit developments causing turmoil in the UK and Pound Sterling. Judging by EURGBP 1-week implied volatility of 6.14 percent, spot prices are anticipated to trade within a 127 pip range between 0.8873 and 0.8747 over the next week with a 68 percent statistical probability. Although, the recent ascent in spot EURGBP could be at risk of reversing lower if the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy Party – also known as the Brexit party – gains traction as it would give a blow to EU proponents.  $$$$ Spot EURJPY has been under pressure since mid-April along with several other ‘risky’ currencies relative to the Japanese Yen as ongoing US China Trade War tension sparked a move to safe-haven currencies. This trend could continue and send EURJPY toward the 122.00 handle where the upward-sloping trendline extended from the January 2ndJPY flash-crash bottom to the intraday low on May 15th could be tested along with the 61.8 percent Fib.  $$$$ That being said, EURJPY 1-week implied volatility of 5.89 percent used to calculate the currency pair’s 1-standard deviation yields a trading range at 122.22-123.92 with a 68 percent statistical probability. Loss of majority power between the European People’s Party and Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats could shudder Euro bulls and push EURJPY back on its more recent downtrend. The risk of further downside in spot EURJPY is also posed by the threat of looming global risk trends and deteriorating market sentiment.  $$$$ - Written by Rich Dvorak, Junior Analyst for DailyFX $$$$ - Follow @RichDvorakFX on Twitter

Fears of the US stepping up efforts to blacklist Chinese telecommunication and surveillance companies are fueling greater concern that US-China trade talks could head in the wrong direction. $$$$ In Japan, these fears could be seen reflected in the Nikkei 225 which traded about 0.7 percent lower. The nation’s benchmark index was weighed down by telecommunication companies, with shares of SoftBank Group down over 5.5%. Elsewhere, the Shanghai Composite and ASX 200 traded about 0.85 and 0.21 percent to the downside. $$$$ The uptick in risk aversion ended up benefiting the anti-risk Japanese Yen, as anticipated. On the flip side of the spectrum, the pro-risk Australian and New Zealand Dollars underperformed, with both currencies also being overshadowed by increasingly dovish RBA and RBNZ monetary policy expectations. The British Pound was also little lower given uncertainty to Brexit if UK Prime Minister Theresa May is ousted. $$$$ European indexes and the Euro are bracing for volatility as the first round of European Parliamentary elections begins. EUR/USD is vulnerable should a greater share of eurosceptic parties gain seats. Meanwhile, there will be a slew of Eurozone PMIs that will offer a gauge of economic performance in the regional bloc.

The modest gains may be the result of reports showing center parties performing better than expected. However, it is worth noting that they are not doing well by historical standards. The European Parliament will likely show greater fragmentation this year than ever before.  $$$$ EURCHF and EURUSD edged higher on cautious optimism, though some weakness is showing $$$$ Exit polls have the European People’s Party (EPP) and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) still occupying the first and second-most seats in parliament, respectively. Collectively, eurosceptic parties have garnered a little under 30 percent of all seats in the legislative branch, though this in no way makes their potential impact and influence any more limited. There is likely much trouble ahead, however, despite this not being reflected in the price movement of the Euro at the moment.  $$$$  Source: Europe Elects $$$$ The lack of volatility could be because the risk associated with the European elections have not yet materialized. On May 28, European leaders will begin discussing prospective candidates to lead key EU institutions including the ECB, European Commission and European Council. The ideological fragmentation in the legislative branch and potential gridlock may be revealed during this particular event. This is where a pickup in Euro volatility may be seen. $$$$ Looking ahead, monitoring the statements from influential eurosceptic party leaders such as Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini will be crucial in gauging the potential level of disruption that may occur in the coming days, weeks and months.

Asia’s second-largest economy is another persistent trade-surplus nation on the White House’s sights. So far the visit seems to have been long on set-piece bilateral bonhomie with Trump suggesting that Tokyo and Washington were getting close to a deal which could address the US/Japan trade deficit which ran at $56.8 billion in 2018. $$$$ Still, the US has threatened tariffs against Japanese car makers and, as with China, there seems to be little expectation that a substantive pact will be inked anytime soon. Trump did say on Monday that he expects a deal with both China and Japan ‘sometime in the future.’ $$$$ Mainboards in Japan and Shanghai were both higher as their Monday closes approached with stocks in Australia, South Korea and Hong Kong all modestly lower.  $$$$ European Parliamentary elections offered the prospect of a more fragmented Parliament.

Britain’s one-issue Brexit party had a stellar crop of seats, with punishment handed out by voters to both the ruling Conservatives and biggest opposition party Labour.  $$$$ Still, the Euro held up pretty well despite it all.

Spot gold plunges below $1,300 after being rejected by technical resistance with added downward pressure from a rallying US Dollar and Treasury rates following yesterday’s release of the Fed’s March FOMC meeting minutes
$$$$
XAUUSD now looks to hold crucial technical support in order to maintain its medium-term bullish uptrend
$$$$

"	"
Gold is sinking today with spot prices trading roughly 1 percent lower and could put the medium-term bullish uptrend at risk if the precious metal falls further. Month-to-date spot gold performance remains in positive territory, however, despite today’s drop pushing gold below psychological support at the $1,300 level. 
$$$$
Spot gold enjoyed a healthy rebound higher earlier this month after prices based at the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement line drawn from the low recorded in November 2018 and top printed in February 2019. Although, the short-lived advance was halted once XAUUSD approached $1,310 yesterday where the 23.6 percent Fib and recent downtrend line rejected further upside. Less-dovish Fed language revealed in the March FOMC minutes could be contributing to the selling pressure in gold considering a surging US Dollar and rebounding interest rates make gold less attractive. 
$$$$
Now, XAUUSD is re-approaching technical support near the $1,285 price where prices have formed a strong area of confluence. Long-term uptrend support formed by the lows in November 2018 and earlier this month has potential to bolster gold prices while the 38.2 percent Fib looks to provide support once again. Nevertheless, a break below the rising trendline would likely threatens gold’s longer-term uptrend while a move above the falling trendline could reassert a bullish bias.

EURUSD overnight implied volatility nearly doubled from 4.65 percent to 8.39 percent, the metric’s highest reading since March 7
$$$$
The jump in anticipated price action is likely in response to potential market-moving event risk from the April ECB meeting and March Fed minutes release tomorrow

EURUSD overnight implied volatility has soared to a one-month high ahead of key event risk posed by the ECB meeting and Fed minutes expected tomorrow. The 1-day implied volatility measure now sits at 8.39 percent which suggests a potential move of 49 pips during Wednesday’s session.  
$$$$
Although, overnight implied volatility remains elevated ahead of key event risk tomorrow, expected price action measures show a slow-and-steady decline overall. The waning trend is likely in response to the most liquid currency pair notching its narrowest trading range since August 2014 according to the 14-day ATR. 
$$$$
The ECB is expected to announce its April monetary policy update at 11:45 GMT Wednesday. Markets will likely focus on supplementary commentary from ECB President Mario Draghi, however, seeing that OIS futures are pricing a 96.7 percent chance that the ECB holds its policy interest rate at -0.40 percent.
$$$$
Aside from the ECB, the US is due to release its latest consumer price index which is projected to show muted signs of inflation. The headline and core CPI measures are slated to cross the wires at 12:30 GMT. If the inflation readings are reported higher than expected, the Fed could be forced to rethink its recent dovish tilt which could support the US Dollar.

$$$$
The Federal Reserve’s FOMC minutes from its March meeting is scheduled for release at 18:00 GMT and will likely cap off Wednesday’s busy session for EURUSD traders. The report is expected to provide further insight on the Fed’s latest dovish position following its decision to cut economic projections and plan to end balance sheet normalization. Language from Fed officials that bolsters confidence by touting a strong economic backdrop could bolster the US Dollar while a tepid stance that leaves the door open for further policy easing may put downward pressure on the USD.
$$$$
Spot EURUSD is trading slightly below the 1.1300 handle after rallying off support found at the 1.1200 price level. The derived trading range calculated from EURUSD overnight implied volatility sees the currency pair trading between 1.1221 and 1.1319 with a 68 percent confidence interval. However, the recent uptrend formed could provide support near the 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement line which rests near the 1.1250 price level. Resistance posed by the 61.8 percent Fib and 100-day EMA could hinder EURUSD upside.

EURUSD Price Edging Higher, ECB Leaves Monetary Settings Unchanged	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/10/EURUSD-Price-Edging-Higher-ECB-Leaves-Monetary-Settings-Unchanged.html	1554897300	"
The EURUSD price continues to climb gently, extending the move upwards that began a week ago.
$$$$
As predicted, there was no news to drive it from the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, which provided no new clues on the future of Eurozone monetary policy.
"	"
The European Central Bank provided no new information today that might drive the EURUSD price in the statement following its as-expected decision to leave all its key interest rates unchanged. However, it is still possible that ECB President Mario Draghi could say something market-moving in his upcoming press conference.
$$$$
Attention will focus on any more news about its proposed new series of quarterly targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III), due to start in September and end in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years and designed “to preserve favorable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy”.
$$$$
Euro traders should also watch out for any indication of a tiered deposit rate system, similar to those in Japan and Switzerland, although that is unlikely for now, and for any downgrades of its economic forecasts. The International Monetary Fund lowered its growth forecasts sharply for the Eurozone Tuesday as Germany stagnates while Italy hits the buffers.
$$$$
Economic growth in the Eurozone could grow by just 1.3% this year after a 1.8% expansion in 2018, the IMF said. Further downside risks could stem from the current trade dispute between the US and the EU that could lead to US tariffs on $11 billion worth of EU imports.
$$$$
As for the Euro, EURUSD has been climbing modestly over the past week and could extend its advance unless Draghi hints at easier monetary policy ahead in his news conference that starts at 1230 GMT. Currently, the ECB is expecting rates to be left unchanged at least through the end of this year.

$$$$
ECB President Mario Draghi will leave monetary policy unchanged again today but his commentary at the subsequent press conference needs to closely followed. At the last meeting President Draghi downgraded EU growth prospects and pushed any interest rate hike further out until at least mid-2020. Recent Euro-Zone data has been mixed ahead of this meeting and is not as weak as prints from the start of the year, but Tuesday’s IMF growth downgrades – within the single-block and globally – will temper any positive sentiment. No further updates are expected on the shape of the latest round of TLTROs or the recently discussed ECB bank tiering, but this could change if Draghi feels that the EZ growth slowdown is becoming entrenched.
$$$$
We will be covering the ECB Meeting Live from 12:30 BST/07:30 EST.  
$$$$
Later in the session the latest FOMC minutes are expected to show that the Fed remains data dependent and will wait patiently before moving interest rates, either up or down. The balance sheet reduction program may be discussed further including duration and the ratio of mortgage-backed securities to US Treasuries on the balance sheet.
$$$$
Around the same time as the FOMC minutes, the EU may well outline the offer of a new Brexit extension to the UK with expectations currently between 9 and 12 months. The extension is expected to include a break clause that would allow the UK to leave earlier if it ratifies the Withdrawal Agreement.
$$$$
Euro volatility remains low and will need an unexpected announcement or update to break it out of its recent torpor.
$$$$
EURUSD remains rangebound although the longer-term trend still points to lower prices. The recent higher low at 1.1182, made on April 2, has applied a brake to the gradual sell-off but price action still suggests a re-test of this level. To the upside, 1.1300 acts as initial resistance before the 200-day moving average comes into play at 1.1424.

Retail traders are 63.9% net-long EURUSD according to the latest IG Client Sentiment Data, a bearish contrarian indicator. However recent daily and weekly positional changes suggest that EURUSD may soon reverse higher despite traders being net-long.

EURUSD implied volatility appears to be relatively low given potential catalysts on deck that could spark serious price action in the currency pair. With overnight and 1-week implied volatility readings on EURUSD forex options contracts currently standing at 5.57 percent and 5.70 percent respectively, currency traders might anticipate an uptick in volatility from these low levels. 
$$$$
The ECB is slated to release minutes from last month’s interest rate meeting at 11:30 GMT tomorrow which look to shed light on the central bank’s latest round of TLTROs. The minutes could also touch on how dovish the ECB is willing to take monetary policy to support Europe’s deteriorating economy. If currency market participants interpret the ECB’s tone as more dovish than initially projected by President Mario Draghi, the Euro could come under pressure. 
$$$$
To close out this week, a slew of US employment data will be announced with the latest unemployment rate and change in non-farm payrolls likely taking the spotlight on Friday. A weak print in US jobs numbers could send the US Dollar lower.

Next week is chalk-full of economic events and data releases that pose significant event risk to EURUSD traders. The ECB is likely to take the spotlight early on in next Wednesday’s session with another monetary policy update. However, the possibility of a weak inflation reading out of the US in addition to the release of the Fed’s minutes from its own monetary policy meeting last month could keep EURUSD weakness at bay. 
$$$$
Check out these key EURUSD technical levels to watch ahead of upcoming event risk.
$$$$
On the contrary, an increasingly dovish ECB or higher than expected US inflation has potential to send EURUSD tumbling. Nevertheless, the FOMC minutes slated to cross the wires at 18:00 GMT next Wednesday might put upward pressure on EURUSD.

USDJPY overnight implied volatility has ticked up slightly from readings printed earlier this week likely in anticipation of tomorrow’s nonfarm payrolls and unemployment data expected out of the US. Implied volatility measures remain depressed across major forex pairs, however, as tempered markets have subdued price action resulting in muted expectations for future volatility. 
$$$$
The relatively low USDJPY implied volatility possibly suggests a snooze-fest for Friday's US jobs data with markets expecting the economic indicators to be reported in line with consensus. Alternatively, the lack of anticipated price action could indicate calm for now with a ‘volatility storm’ lurking on the horizon.

Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets.

Tomorrow’s economic data out of Japan and the US very well might serve as potential catalysts that spark a sizeable move in USDJPY spot prices – especially if NFP data surprises materially above or below estimates. Bloomberg median consensus for March’s NFP lists 170,000 as the headline jobs figure expected which compares to February’s reading of a mere 20,000 additions.

The tech sector continued its history of outperformance this week, as the XLK ETF reached record highs. Compared to the S&P 500, the sector boasts its highest ratio versus the index since the latter half of the dot-com bubble burst in January 2001.

With the index itself grasping to recapture record levels, the strength of the current rally looks to be waning amid mounting headwinds ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC meeting minutes. Global growth concerns, trade war fears and earnings season jitters have all sought to derail investor sentiment just as some of the index’s favorite names have reclaimed their luster. Wednesday’s Fed minutes and a corresponding ECB policy decision may carry enough weight to deliver a meaningful shift in sentiment.

Tuesday’s “calm before the storm” tepidness was reflected in low trading volume (the lowest for the index in five months) for the S&P 500 and a slight increase in the VIX. Elsewhere, anticipation for the events was reflected in heightened implied volatility across several currency pairs – especially EURUSD.

EURUSD, along with S&P500 and DAX futures began to fall following the IMF’s publication on the outlook for global growth being at its lowest point since the financial crisis. Risk aversion was further compounded by news that the Italian economy may only expand 0.1 percent (down from the 1.0 estimate) and the budget deficit forecast was widened to 2.5%, substantially larger than what Rome and Brussels had agreed upon. 
$$$$
DAX, S&P500 Futures, EURUSD – 15-Minute Chart 
$$$$
As forecasted in late 2018 and at the start of the year, the respite offered to markets by the fragile agreement between Rome and Brussels was an ethereal pause. The recessionary pressure and revised GDP numbers next to a bigger-than expected budget deficit could just be enough to push Brussels to reopen the budget case. This comes as the US pivots away from a trade conflict with China and appears to be now entering a new trade spat with the EU, another weight the economy will have to lift. 
$$$$
Looking ahead – specifically tomorrow – there are a number of major event risks. The ECB will be releasing its rate hike decision followed by a press conference with Mario Draghi. The commentary will likely echo a similar tone struck at the last meeting, only this time the urgency may be greater, and the outlook less certain. 
$$$$
Another European-based risk is the EU’s verdict on whether to grant the UK an extension during the emergency summit in Brussels. Traders will also be eyeing the release of the FOMC meeting minutes, another major indicator to watch.

Canadian Dollar Climbs with Crude Oil, USDCAD Falls to Support	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/08/canadian-dollar-climbs-with-crude-oil-usdcad-falls-to-support.html	1554759360	"
Crude oil prices have surged nearly 2 percent higher in today's session and is boosting the Canadian Dollar
$$$$
USDCAD now rests at key technical support after dipping over half a percent to the 1.3310 handle 
$$$$
Looking to expand your trading knowledge? Check out these Crude Oil Facts
"	"
CAD is gaining ground today with the CXY Canadian Dollar Index advancing 0.59 percent. The move higher is likely in response to soaring crude oil prices which appear to have breached another level of resistance amid curbed supply and fading global growth concerns. Consequently, USDCAD is being weighed down as the Canadian economy generally benefits from higher energy prices. 
$$$$
USDCAD now trades around the 1.3310 price which appears to be a key level of support. If the currency pair fails to base at this area of confluence, additional downside risk could be on the table. USDCAD has held this price level for the most part, however, with the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement line proving support. Also, spot USDCAD rebounded slightly after touching its 100-day EMA while the bullish channel remains intact. 
$$$$
Although, USDCAD weakness could be exacerbated if crude oil prices continue to rise. The currency pair has developed a short-term downtrend from the string of lower highs recorded throughout March which could hinder further advances. If spot prices fall below current support, forex traders will likely eye the 50.0 percent retracement line as the next possible area for USDCAD to base.
$$$$
That being said, event risk posed by the Fed meeting minutes due for release Wednesday – language that is interpreted as more dovish than expected could send spot USDCAD plunging to the 1.3220 level where the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement line and rising trendline support meet.

$$$$

"	"
GBPUSD overnight implied volatility took a nosedive from 12.7 percent yesterday to a mere 7.6 percent today in response to the latest Brexit developments. The move lower in anticipated British Pound price action likely follows the reduced probability of no-deal Brexit after EUCO President Donald Tusk and European Union leaders agreed to delay the UK’s departure for a second time.
$$$$
Prior to the EUCO’s offer to extend the Brexit deadline again, the UK was slated to sever itself from the EU on April 12 without a deal following British MPs rejection of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement three separate times.  
$$$$
Check out this Brexit Timeline for a chronological list of events surrounding the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and how negations have affected markets.
$$$$
Consequently, the ongoing impasse in the House of Commons increased the risk of a no-deal, ‘hard’ Brexit which bid up Sterling implied volatility measures. Now that British Parliament has until October 31 to decide the next direction of Brexit, currency option traders are no longer expecting significant price swings in the near future which is expressed by GBPUSD 1-week implied volatility plunging to its lowest level since December 2018. 
$$$$
Implied volatility is an indirect variable derived from currency option contracts and is often viewed as a quantitative measure of hedging costs. With less uncertainty, hedging costs tend to fall as well considering the reduced level of risk. Consequently, the 6-month Brexit delay appears to have significantly reduced the risk of a major move in GBPUSD. However, this could in turn suggest that GBPUSD may trade in more established ranges instead of daily Brexit headlines regularly threatening sudden swells that carry the risk of developing into breakouts. 
$$$$
According to the derived 7-month implied volatility which encompasses the new October 31 Brexit deadline, GBPUSD will likely trade within a range of 1.2333 and 1.3843 over the next 7 months. This implied trading range aligns closely with the 76.4 percent and 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement lines drawn from the low in October 2016 and high in April 2018 - levels that could also provide technical support and resistance. Although, spot prices could continue to coil between rising and falling trendlines shown above while the 61.8 percent and 38.2 percent Fibs may serve as other areas of confluence.
$$$$
Check out IG’s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold, Bitcoin and S&P500.

The latest client positioning data from IG shows that 69.0 percent of GBPUSD traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.23 to 1. According to the data, the number of traders net-long is 3.9 percent lower than yesterday but 14.5 percent higher than last week. Similarly, the number of traders net-short is 0.5 percent higher than yesterday and 15.7 percent lower than last week.

EURUSD market volatility continues to remain at multi-month low levels, making the pair difficult to trade on a daily basis. The Average True Range – a 14-day moving average of the true ranges - is currently just 45 pips, down from 76 pips at the start of the year, making day-trading difficult at best. The overall chart set-up still points to lower prices – in line with the ECB’s lower-for-longer interest rates – with recent upticks in the pair caused more by US dollar weakness than EUR strength.
$$$$
The ECB has already announced that it will launching another round of 2-year TLTROs later this year but, as yet, has not released any details. Yesterday, an ‘ECB sources’ story said that the central bank was considering offering loans to banks at zero or even negative interest rates to boost the borrowing bank’s balance sheet and help stoke growth in the Euro-Zone. According to the Reuters story, the central bank even discussed offering the new round of TLTROs at -0.4%, the ECB’s deposit rate.

Currency Volatility: What Does AUDJPY Price Action Suggest for Risk Assets?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/12/currency-volatility-audjpy-price-action-suggest-risk-assets.html	1555099200	"
AUDJPY 1-week implied volatility has collapsed to 7 percent from 16 percent at the beginning of 2019

The Australian Dollar has appreciated meaningfully against the Japanese Yen so far this year as recovering market sentiment and cratering volatility have supported ‘risky’ currencies such as the Kiwi relative to ‘safe-haven’ counterparts like the Yen.
$$$$
In fact, AUDJPY has inked year-to-date spot returns in excess of 5 percent while the currency pair’s 1-week implied volatility has dropped from 16 percent to 7 percent at the same time.
$$$$
Moreover, AUDJPY 1-month implied volatility now sits at its lowest level in over a year. Aussie-Yen implied volatility has been on a steady decline since the Japanese Yen Flash Crash back in early January. 
$$$$
Subsequent to this event, AUDJPY has mirrored the rise in global equities with investor concerns over the slowing global growth getting pushed to the back seat following dovish monetary policy from central banks around the world aiming to restore market confidence. The Kiwi also received positive attention as the US-China Trade War progressively deescalated. 
$$$$
Collapsing currency market implied volatility is not isolated to AUDJPY and has impacted several major currency pairs. While forex traders typically fiend for market volatility, the lack thereof has increased the relative attractiveness for currency carry trades.
$$$$
Consequently, the demand for traders to go long high-yielding currencies like the Australian Dollar and take a short position on low-yielding currencies like the Japanese Yen has likely contributed to the strong advance of AUDJPY.
$$$$
Furthermore, the Deutsche Bank G10 Currency Carry Trade Index has gained roughly 4 percent so far this year which outperforms spot returns across the major currency pairs. If volatility across markets continues to fall, the carry trade and risk assets could keep rising as a result.

EURUSD Price Breaks Below 1.1300 on ECB Growth Concerns Rumor	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/16/EURUSD-Price-Breaks-Below-1.1300-on-ECB-Growth-Concerns-Rumor.html	1555407720	"
EURUSD unmoved on ZEW data but dips on Reuters ECB growth forecast rumor.

Euro seemingly capped at current levels; client sentiment is bearish.

Q2 2019 EUR Forecast and USD Top Trading Opportunities
$$$$
The latest German and Euro-Area ZEW data paints a mixed picture with sentiment pushing higher while the assessment of the economic situation in Germany deteriorates further.
$$$$
According to ZEW President Achim Wambach, ‘The slight improvement recorded by the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment is largely based on the hope that the global economic environment will develop less poorly than previously assumed. The postponement of the Brexit deadline may also have contributed to buoy the economic outlook. By contrast, the latest figures regarding incoming orders and industrial production in the German industry point to a rather weak economic development’.
$$$$
The ZEW data had little impact of the single-currency which post-release fell suddenly on Reuters ‘sources’ headlines which said that several ECB members doubted projections of a growth rebound in H2 and some questioned the accuracy of the forecasting models. While still only a rumor, if growth projections are under question, as well as the modelling, the single currency may turn lower-for-longer and re-test recent lows.
$$$$
EURUSD printed a low of 1.1279 straight after the rumor hit the screens and briefly broke below the 200-day ma. Support sits at 1.1216 before the 1.1176, the recent 22-month low.

"	"
AUDUSD could experience a volatile session tomorrow considering overnight forex options contracts are pricing in the largest expected move for spot prices since the flash-crash witnessed by markets on January 3. Uncertainty surrounding Thursday’s high-impact economic data out of Australia and the US has likely bid up AUDUSD 1-day implied volatility to its second highest reading of the year. 
$$$$
Australia’s economic data is expected to cross the wires at 1:30 GMT during Thursday’s session. Markets are expected to closely scrutinize the Aussie employment numbers for potential insight into the country’s labor market, especially considering tepid language found in the Reserve Bank of Australia’s March meeting minutes published yesterday.
$$$$
The RBA’s remarks unsurprisingly weighted negatively on AUDUSD seeing that the central bank stated a decrease in the overnight cash rate would likely be appropriate if inflation fails to firm and unemployment trends higher.
$$$$
Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets. 
$$$$
Although Australian employment numbers will likely take the spotlight for AUDUSD traders during Thursday’s session, a slew of economic data out of the US could weigh on the currency pair later in the day. It’s worth mentioning that the Citi US Economic Surprise Index shows a sizeable drop-off since January, indicating that America’s economic data has broadly surprised to the downside as of late. 
$$$$
That being said, a data-dependent Fed could adopt a dovish tilt following suit from central banks around the world if leading indicators like the Markit Services and Manufacturing PMIs disappoint. On the contrary, better than expected economic reports out of the US will likely bolster the greenback. 
$$$$
According to AUDUSD overnight implied volatility, the currency pair is calculated to trade between 0.7139 and 0.7231 with a 68 percent statistical probability. Spot AUDUSD currently trades at 0.71659 with prices forming a rising channel since the beginning of the month. Recent gains have pushed the Aussie above near-side resistance from the downtrend line formed by the tops printed on December 4, 2018 and January 31, 2019. Yesterday’s advance also helped reclaim the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement line drawn from the flash-crash low on January 3 this year to its 2019 high – a level that now looks to serve as technical support. 
$$$$
However, if Australian economic data falters tomorrow, AUDUSD fundamentals could quickly weaken considering the RBA has a previously stated that a deteriorating jobs market would likely put a rate cut on the table. That being said, an increase in the unemployment rate has potential to send spot AUDUSD plunging. With overnight implied volatility suggesting a mere 46 pip move, the possibility of a risk-reversal could be underpriced. On the contrary, a robust employment report could drive AUDUSD to fresh month-to-date high. 
$$$$
Check out IG’s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold, Bitcoin and S&P500. 
$$$$
The latest AUDUSD trader sentiment data from IG shows that 43.4 percent of traders are net-long resulting in a ratio of traders short to long at -1.31 to 1. Moreover, the number of traders net-long is 7.3 percent lower than yesterday and 10.9 percent lower relative to last week.

The pair has not been helped by Eurozone PMIs implying that a possible pickup in China’s economy has yet to filter through to Europe.

The PMIs imply that growth in Germany, France and the Eurozone as a whole remains tepid, with the table below showing the latest data and the comparable figures for a month earlier.

Thursday’s PMIs also showed little growth elsewhere, with only a marginal increase in business activity in Australia, and the Japan manufacturing PMI below the 50 mark separating expansion from contraction for the third straight month.

Hopes are low too for the US PMIs due later in the session, with economists expecting a small pickup in the US manufacturing PMI in April offset by a decline in the US services sector.

The US dollar is pushing back to its best level in nearly two weeks as investors go long the greenback ahead of the long weekend. Recent US-China trade commentary is mildly risk-positive, but markets are seemingly running out of steam to the upside, sparking concerns of a sharp retrace, especially in a market constrained by suffocating price ranges. FX volatility is touching multi-year lows which leaves the door ajar to a sharp market realignment, adding to the US dollars allure. In addition, the yield spread between 10-year US Treasuries (2.56%) and German Bunds (0.05%) continues to be more than 250 basis points, a healthy USD carry premium.

What Could Collapsing Currency Volatility Spell for the Forex Market?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/18/Collapsing-currency-volatility-across-forex-market-whats-next.html	1555616040	"
Forex traders have witnessed currency price action seemingly evaporate from the market as macroeconomic risks such as Brexit and the US-China Trade War appear to have subsided 
$$$$
While several uncertainties appear to have moved to the backburner, it is probable that volatility will eventually flare up again and even more likely to occur during periods of low liquidity as is typical around global holidays
$$$$
Check out this article for information on the Top 10 Most Volatile Currency Pairs and How to Trade Them
"	"
Forex market volatility has cratered to lows not seen in years. In fact, the Cboe Currency Volatility Index for the Euro, Yen, and British Pound have all plunged to their lowest levels on record since the financial instruments began trading in 2015. 
$$$$
Although British Pound price action was on the rise as Brexit uncertainty sent the Sterling swinging in response to the latest headline, delaying the UK’s departure date to October 31 has sent GBPUSD implied volatility nose-diving.
$$$$
Rebounding market optimism with the help of central bank dovishness subsequent to last year’s widespread selloff has similarly contributed to the collapse in volatility for the Euro and Yen. 
$$$$
EURUSD’s average-true-range has dropped to a mere 14 pips which is the metric’s lowest reading since September 8, 2014. Although, the last time spot EURUSD price action was this muted, currency traders subsequently experienced a sharp return in volatility between August 2014 and June 2015. 
$$$$
Likewise, the average-true-range for USDJPY has also collapsed to its lowest level since September 8, 2014. However, similar to the proverbial law of physics ‘what goes up must come down,’ volatility can only stay so low for so long before a catalyst emerges that sparks a significant market move. 
$$$$
The most recent occurrence of this was at the beginning of the year when Apple lowered its earnings guidance which sent a shockwave across APAC markets and ignited a currency flash-crash in the Japanese Yen.
$$$$
Now with Brexit delayed for another 6 months, the US-China trade war supposedly coming to an end and rebounding global economic growth expectations, several of the market’s largest risks have dwindled. These developments have contributed to the overarching risk rally and has increased the relative attractiveness for currency carry trades due to dissipating uncertainty and related volatility.
$$$$
That being said, these risks albeit less prevalent are still unresolved. If uncertainty regarding these issues flares up or factor jolts market sentiment and risk appetite, this could just be the ‘calm before the storm.’

EURUSD Price Slips Back After Ifo Index Disappoints	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/24/EURUSD-Price-Slips-Back-After-Ifo-Index-Disappoints.html	1556094900	"
The business climate in Germany deteriorated unexpectedly in April, according to the Ifo Institute.
$$$$
That added to the evidence that the German economy is spluttering and weakened EURUSD.
"	"
You can find our second-quarter forecasts for the Euro and other currencies here
$$$$
EURUSD fell back Wednesday after the German Ifo Institute reported that its business climate index dropped to 99.2 in April from a revised 99.7 in March. An increase to 99.9 had been predicted by economists.
$$$$
Moreover, its current assessment index and its expectations measure both missed expectations too, prompting Ifo to say that economic growth in Germany is likely to be weaker than the 0.8% forecast, with the industrial sector dragging the economy lower. “The German economy continues to lose steam,” Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
$$$$
In response, EURUSD weakened for the second successive session, extending the decline recorded over the past week.

Q2 2019 EUR Forecast and USD Top Trading Opportunities
$$$$
EURUSD remains under pressure from an ongoing combination of weak Euro-Zone data releases and US dollar strength. The pair slipped below 1.1200 yesterday and trade either side of this level currently. The latest German Ifo release missed expectations, sparking a small sell-off, but buyers seem to be picking-up offers around 1.1200 for the time being. The Ifo release was the last Euro-Zone data of the week, leaving short-term EURUSD direction in the hands of the US dollar.
$$$$
The current US dollar strength may come under pressure from two upcoming releases. On Thursday the first look at US durable goods orders with expectations for a pick-up in March to 0.8% from a prior -1.6%, while on Friday the first look at US Q1 GDP is released at 12:30 GMT with expectations of 2.2% annualized q/q growth. Any miss would push the US dollar lower from its current lofty levels.

Will US GDP Stoke Currency Volatility Across USD Forex Pairs Tomorrow?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/25/us-gdp-usd-currency-volatility-stoked-tomorrow.html	1556222700	"
Overnight implied volatility metrics for major USD currency pairs leaps ahead of Friday’s US GDP data release which may potentially stoke a sizable market reaction
$$$$
The DXY US Dollar Index recently surged above technical resistance to its highest level since May 2017 and could suggest USD traders are expecting tomorrow’s GDP numbers to beat estimates 
$$$$
Take a look at this article for information on How to Trade the Top 10 Most Volatile Currency Pairs or download the free DailyFX Q2 USD Forecastfor comprehensive fundamental and technical insight on the US Dollar over the second quarter
"	"
Forex traders are starting to see signs that currency volatility could be ticking higher, led by the latest surge in the US Dollar. In fact, recent USD gains has pushed the DXY US Dollar Index above key resistance at the 98.00 price level which is its highest reading in nearly 2 years. 
$$$$
Prior to the greenback’s latest advance, forex market volatility was seemingly evaporating. But, price action looks to be picking up again judging by rising implied volatility which interestingly aligns with tomorrow’s potentially market-moving economic data. 
$$$$
Performance in the major USD crosses tomorrow will largely depend on how closely actual Q1 US GDP is reported to consensus. Fed funds futures are currently pricing a 45 percent probability that the Fed will cut interest rates by its December 11 FOMC meeting.
$$$$
If economic growth comes in above the 2.2 percent estimate, the odds that the Fed lowers its benchmark interest rate will likely drop which usually lifts the US Dollar. On the other hand, if GDP crosses the wires below forecast, markets could begin pricing in a higher likelihood that the Fed cuts rates this year. 
$$$$
Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets. 
$$$$
Currency pairs of interest highlights EURUSD, USDJPY and AUDUSD. Greenback gains could be limited against the Euro if GDP surprises to the upside considering recent EURUSD price action. On the other hand, there could be more room for the USD to run against the Aussie considering weak inflation out of Australia likely sets up the RBA for a rate cut.
$$$$
Also, a US GDP beat would likely enhance risk appetite and send traders flocking out of anti-risk currencies like the Japanese Yen, especially given the BOJ’s reiterated dovishness. That being said, JPY could see a boost from US GDP coming in below estimates, particularly if the report is bleak enough to reignite market pessimism and flight to ‘safe-haven’ securities.

Currency Volatility: Japanese Yen Eyes Upcoming BOJ Rate Decision	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/24/currency-volatility-japanese-yen-bank-of-japan-rate-decision.html	1556133240	"
Overnight volatility measures tick higher across JPY currency pairs in anticipation of tomorrow’s rate review and monetary policy update from the Bank of Japan 
$$$$
The BOJ will also release its latest outlook for economic activity and prices which looks to accompany a slew of data points such as industrial production and retail trade
$$$$

"	"
USDJPY overnight implied volatility jumped to 5.61 percent, a multi-week high, as forex traders gear up for potential price swings in response to the Bank of Japan’s interest rate decision expected during Thursday’s session. 
$$$$
BOJ monetary policy is expected to remain unchanged after its April meeting, however, considering the central bank already announced a reduction to its bond purchase program by 20 billion Yen per month last week. That being said, commentary from BOJ Governor Kuroda – particularly on inflation – will likely be closely examined by markets. 
$$$$
Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets. 
$$$$
Aside from the BOJ taking the spotlight in Thursday’s session, several economic data points may potentially weigh on the Yen’s performance. Forex traders could turn to Japan’s inflation and jobless rates in addition to year-over-year changes in industrial production and retail trade if no surprises come from the BOJ and Governor Kuroda. 
$$$$
USDJPY has formed an incredibly tight trading range which has largely contributed to the collapse in currency market volatility. Spot prices appear to have coiled between resistance at the 112.00 handle and support provided by the upward-sloping trendline formed from the low recorded during the Yen flash crash at the beginning of the year.
$$$$
Tomorrow’s high-impact event risk could easily serve as a catalyst for overdue volatility and spark a sizeable move outside of current technical levels. That being said, the trading range derived from overnight implied volatility estimates that USDJPY will trade between 111.45 and 112.11 with a 68 percent statistical probability. 
$$$$
Check out IG’s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold, Bitcoin and S&P500.

According to client positioning data from IG, 38.8 percent of USDJPY traders are net-long resulting in a short to long ratio of -1.58 to 1. However, the number of traders net-long is 15.5 percent higher than yesterday and 10.2 percent higher than last week.

Currency Volatility Could Ignite with EZ GDP, FOMC, US NFP Next Week	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/26/Currency-volatility-japan-eur-cad-gdp-fed.html	1556308980	"
Following today’s US GDP report, traders will turn their attention to the slew of economic events and data releases on tap next week for further clarity on the market’s next direction
$$$$
Although 1-week implied volatility metrics across the major currency pairs remains subdued, forex market price action is beginning to show signs that volatility could soon turn higher
$$$$
Take a look at this article for information on How to Trade the Top 10 Most Volatile Currency Pairs
"	"
The latest stretch of gains in the US Dollar appears to have stoked forex market volatility over the last few days of trading. However, price action looks to have been in anticipation of Q1 US GDP which was released earlier today. With this data now in the rearview mirror, what risks have potential to propel further currency volatility next week?   
$$$$
First on the list of possible volatility triggers is Japan’s Golden Week where the Japanese will observe a consecutive 10-day holiday celebrating the country’s emperors among other national events. With Japan’s financial markets closed all next week, traders might expect limited liquidity and raises the risk of rampant price swings. In fact, the last time the Japanese markets were closed on holiday while other markets were still open was on the January 3 JPY flash-crash.
$$$$
Consequently, AUDJPY will be an interesting currency pair to keep an eye on next week. According to 1-week implied volatility measures, AUDJPY traders might expect spot prices to fluctuate between 77.940 and 79.238 with a 68 percent statistical probability. The 1-week implied high and low aligns well with Fibonacci support and resistance which have contributed to the narrow trading range observed since the January 3 flash-crash. 
$$$$
Shifting to hard economic data, the Eurozone is slated to release its Q1 GDP report during Tuesday’s session. If the numbers show an improvement in the Eurozone’s economic growth and surprise to the EURUSD could attempt to rebound from its recent selloff. On the contrary, if the report fails to provide reasons for optimism, the Euro could continue to come under pressure. The 1-week EURUSD trading range derived from implied volatility priced into forex option contracts estimates that the currency pair will trade between 1.1086 and 1.1230 with a 68 percent statistical probability. 
$$$$
Later on Tuesday, Canada will also release its GDP numbers and could draw a reaction in USDCAD. Last week, the Bank of Canada rate decision weighed negatively on the Canadian Dollar given dovish language found in the Governing Council’s press statement and follow up commentary from Stephen Poloz. If Canada’s GDP report echoes timid economic activity in the country, more pain could be expected for the loonie. Also worth noting is the recent downside in oil which might pose as another headwind to CAD upside. 
$$$$
Taking the spotlight for the US Dollar will be Wednesday’s FOMC decision. Although the Fed is expected to remain on hold according to OIS pricing, Chair Jerome Powell will likely provide markets with an update on the central bank’s latest view on monetary policy – particularly in context of the latest US GDP report. 
$$$$
Fed futures are still pricing a 25-bps cut by the end of the year despite the huge upside surprise in first quarter economic growth. Although, the Federal Reserve will likely indicate its relatively hawkish or dovish tilt at this upcoming meeting which could warrant a sizable reaction in the USD. In fact, expected USD price action has rebounded higher shown in the chart below.
$$$$
To cap off the week, US Nonfarm Payroll data will be released in addition to the ISM Services Index for April. Further improvement in US economic data will likely reduce market expectations for a rate cut from the Fed this year and could boost the greenback. On the contrary, weakness in America’s job market could give markets the jitters if this cornerstone of the US economy shows signs of deterioration.

EURUSD Brushes Off Consumer Confidence Weakness, Heavyweight Data Ahead	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/29/EURUSD-Brushes-Off-Consumer-Confidence-Weakness-Heavyweight-Data-Ahead.html	1556530620	 EURUSD Pushing Higher  $$$$ Eurozone Confidence Data 	 The EURUSD continues to push higher past 1.1150 after seeing new 2019 lows of 1.1110 last Friday following better than expected US GDP figures. The uptrend, which started on the back of the Spanish Election outcome, was continuing this morning as the lack of material figures from the Eurozone saw the EUR’s sensitivity to Consumer Confidence figures reinforced. On release of the figures, the pair moved slightly lower but quickly bounced back surpassing the 1.1164 line.  $$$$ As the session ahead has little in terms of key economic releases from the Eurozone, the main driver on the currency pair is expected this afternoon when the US Price and Spending figures are released.  $$$$ EUR Forecast: Traders Eye Eurozone GDP, Jobs, CPI Data Upcoming $$$$ EURUSD traders will now look ahead to the provisional Eurozone Q1 GDP figures out Tuesday which are expected to show a slight increase from 0.2% to 0.3%, despite the Brexit drag. At the end of the week, the first look at Eurozone inflation data will be closely watched. Inflation in the single-block is expected to tick up to 1.6% from 1.4% y/y. $$$$ DailyFX Economic Calendar. $$$$ The final figures for Consumer Confidence in the month of April remain constant at -7.9 as the Eurozone Economic Confidence hits its lowest level since September 2016 at 104. $$$$ Despite an increase from 11.3 to 11.5 in the Eurozone Services Confidence, which accounts for roughly two thirds of total Euro-zone GDP, it has not proved to be enough to halt the decline in Economic Confidence. The fall is mainly led by a deterioration of Industrial Confidence from -1.7 to -2, which accounts for 40% of the Index. This figure asks for production expectations, meaning that a deterioration indicates a negative outlook for the future of the business spending and capital investment.

Implied volatility measures remain subdued, but signs continue to emerge that currency volatility could soon return to forex markets and aligns with risks from high-impact economic data and events this week that could trigger price action
$$$$
Traders will likely examine tomorrow’s slew of GDP data which is expected to primarily impact the Euro, Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar
$$$$
Take a look at How to Trade the Top 10 Most Volatile Currency Pairsor read up on Market Cycle Phases, Stages and Common Characteristics for additional insight 
"	"
Unsurprisingly, EURUSD overnight implied volatility spiked ahead of tomorrow’s economic growth data from the Eurozone and now sits at 5.78 percent, slightly above its 2019 average. EURUSD 1-Day expected price action has drifted lower, however, from a reading of 7.23 percent before the US GDP report release last Friday. 
$$$$
This could indicate that currency traders are expecting Eurozone GDP (1Q19 YoY) to fall relatively in line with the 1.1 percent forecast whereas more uncertainty clouded expectations for US GDP data. 
$$$$
Yet, tepid expectations have only grown bleaker for EU economic growth following a series of downward GDP revisions for 4Q18 GDP – the final reading of 1.1 percent drastically halved initial estimates of 2.2 percent. 
$$$$
More recently, several economic indicators out of the EU have painted a dreary picture of Eurozone fundamentals and could potentially suggest that the bloc’s GDP data may disappoint once again. 
$$$$
As such, EURUSD traders could witness a swing in spot prices greater than the implied move of 34 pipsif tomorrow’s high-impact GDP data surprises to the downside. On the contrary, if Eurozone economic growth prints an upbeat report, spot EURUSD may quickly reclaim the 1.2000 handle.
$$$$
Although, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement line drawn from the low on January 1, 2017 and high on February 11, 2018 could pose a significant headwind to Euro upside against the US Dollar. That being said, EURUSD trader sentiment data from IG still shows a mixed trading bias despite net-short positions increasing by 20.4 percent relative to last week.
$$$$
Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets. 
$$$$
Shifting to the Mexican Peso, one of the most actively traded emerging market currencies, USDMXN has potential to gyrate tomorrow in response to Mexico’s GDP release. Trade between Mexico and the United States has grown into a somewhat touchy subject as the two countries approach final stages of ratifying the new-NAFTA, USMCA trade agreement along with Canada.
$$$$
Friction over President Trump’s unwillingness to alleviate tariffs on steel and aluminum imports while concerns voiced among politicians remain material hurdles to signing the deal into law. The lack of clarity over trade policies have potential of weighing negatively on business decisions and consumption which could drag economic activity lower as a result. 
$$$$
Moreover, Friday’s US GDP report detailed that imports dropped a sizable 3.7 percent over the first quarter – a negative sign for Mexico seeing that the country relies on the US for roughly 80 percent of its exports. Judging by USDMXN overnight implied volatility, spot prices are estimated to trade between 18.893 and 19.096 with a 68 percent statistical probability. 
$$$$
If Mexico’s GDP misses to the downside, USDMXN could continue its recent ascent. However, the 61.8 percent and 50.0 percent retracement lines drawn from the low on March 20 and high on March 29 of this year might serve as technical resistance. Conversely, if Mexico inks a solid GDP report above the 1.4 percent estimate, USDMXN has potential of targeting downtrend support formed by the lows on April 22 and April 29, which also comes into alignment with the 76.4 Fib level.

EURUSD remains within a noted downtrend but may be looking to continue its recent correct bounce higher with the 1.1200 handle in already broken. Today’s Euro-Zone q/q GDP data came in marginally better-than-expected - 0.4% vs 0.3% expectations and 0.2% prior - while recent indications are that German CPI later today may also surprise to the upside after recent regional results.

Currency Volatility: All Eyes on the Fed and US Dollar Tomorrow	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/30/currency-volatility-usdollar-fed-usd-dxy-eyes-fomc.html	1556667000	"
USD overnight implied volatility skyrockets to its highest reading in over a month to 8.73 percent while the DXY US Dollar Index recedes from its recent top at 98.33, a price level not seen since May 2017
$$$$
Traders will closely look for key insight from the Federal Reserve tomorrow as markets digest the latest FOMC interest rate decision and follow-up commentary from Chair Jerome Powell on Fed policy and the US economy

"	"
Currency market volatility has begun to rebound from the unprecedented lows experienced by traders lately. Judging by the DXY US Dollar Overnight Implied Volatility Index, forex price action appears to be trending higher. In fact, the metric has jumped to 8.73 percent, its highest level since March 20, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s FOMC meeting tomorrow.
$$$$
If Fed Chair Powell touts Friday’s US GDP report and other positive economic developments, it could reduce rate cut bets which are currently pricing a 67 percent probability that the Federal Reserve lowers its policy interest rate by 25 basis points before the end of the year. 
$$$$
On the contrary, if the Fed reiterates a patient approach and focuses on downside market risks, the odds that the FOMC decides to cut rates could be expected to move higher which would likely weigh negatively on the US Dollar.  
$$$$
The US Dollar advanced steeply throughout April and notched its highest close since May 2017 before pulling back over the last few days. Now, the greenback’s next direction hinges largely on the relative dovish or hawkish tone from the Fed tomorrow. 
$$$$
That being said, the DXY Index is estimated to trade between 97.07 and 97.97 with a 68 percent statistical probability judging by US Dollar overnight implied volatility. Downside could be limited by trendline support, however, which happens to align with the 20-day moving average and 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level as well. 
$$$$
Currency pairs worth watching over the next 24-hours highlights EURUSD and USDJPY. The Euro just reclaimed the 1.1200 level against the US Dollar following the Eurozone’s relatively upbeat GDP report released during Tuesday’s session. 
$$$$
Looking to the Japanese Yen, USDJPY should be closely monitored as Japan’s financial markets remain closed in observation of its Golden Week – the lack of liquidity raises JPY flash crash risk.
$$$$

$$$$
Prior to the Fed tomorrow, the ADP Change in Employment and ISM Manufacturing Index will be released at 12:15 GMT and 14:00 GMT respectively.Although the market’s reaction to the Fed will largely dictate tomorrow’s price action, these economic indicators have potential of setting the tone for trader sentiment and risk appetite during Wednesday’s session.

Currency Volatility: New Zealand Dollar Eyes RBNZ Rate Review	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/03/26/Currency-volatility-new-zealand-dollar-eyes-rbnz-rate-review.html	1553626800	"
NZDUSD overnight implied volatility soars to its highest level since February 12 ahead of tomorrow’s monetary policy update from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand 
$$$$
Although NZD forex traders are expecting the RBNZ to keep rates on hold, language from Governor Adrian Orr will likely provide insight on the central bank’s next move
$$$$
Enhance your knowledge about currencies with this educational article on How Central Banks Impact the Forex Market
"	"
NZDUSD forex option traders are expecting sizable price action from the currency pair Wednesday according to overnight implied volatility. In fact, the 1-day measure jumped to 14.95 percent – the highest reading in over a month – ahead of Wednesday’s Official Cash Rate announcement from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.
$$$$
The RBNZ has held the OCR at 1.75 percent since November 2016 and expects to hold its interest rate steady through this year and next according to previous statements. Despite the market’s consensus that the RBNZ will leave its OCR unchanged at 1.75 percent this March, there is still a 33 percent probability of a cut from the central bank priced in through swaps out to August. Consequently, Governor Orr’s commentary on the group’s economic view and accounting of external risks could generate a market response. 
$$$$
Keeping an eye out for changes in language from February’s monetary policy statement could provide insight on which direction NZDUSD moves after tomorrow’s decision. Seeing that last month’s statement said the next OCR move could be up or down, Kiwi-Dollar forex traders will likely look for updates to the ‘key judgements and risks’ that affect the RBNZ’s interest rate decision.  
$$$$
Another factor potentially fueling expectations for greater NZDUSD volatility could be the currency pair’s technical picture. Firstly, NZDUSD’s 20-day average-true-range has taken a plunge since the indicator’s recent high of 63 pips this past December is near its multi-month low of 52 pips. Looking at this gauge with a contrarian lens might suggest a looming reversal of this trend as it did back in October when NZDUSD’s ATR was at a similar level. 
$$$$
Second, the 78.6 percent and 100.0 percent Fibonacci retracement lines derived from the respective low and high in October and December are currently sandwiching NZDUSD. That leaves prices room to move before prominent technical boundaries are overrun. Nevertheless, currency market participants can project an expected range between 0.6863 and 0.6971 if overnight implied volatility measures are to be believed. 
$$$$
Check out IG’s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold, Bitcoin and S&P500. 
$$$$
NZDUSD traders have a bearish bias headed into tomorrow’s RBNZ announcement according to client positioning data from IG which shows 39.0 percent of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.57 to 1. Additionally, the number of traders net-short is 25.7 percent higher than yesterday and 13.7 percent higher from last week.

Brexit Uncertainty Leaves GBPUSD Implied Volatility At 32-Month Highs	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/03/21/GBPUSD-Price-Currency-Volatility-Brexit-Uncertainty.html	1553181240	"
A potential no-deal ""hard Brexit"" remains 8 days away after a series of votes rejected PM Theresa May’s latest Withdrawal Agreement last week despite MPs also opposing a no-deal departure 
$$$$
Sterling traders now await the EU’s decision if the other 27 member countries will approve the UK’s request to delay Brexit to June 30
$$$$
Check out this Brexit Timeline and read up on What Every British Pound Trader Needs to Know to sharpen your GBP knowledge and trading skills 
"	"
Given the latest Brexit uncertainty, it cannot be overstated the potential volatility the Pound faces. In fact, GBPUSD currency option traders are pricing in 18.81 percent and 16.75 percent implied volatility on the 1-Day and 1-Week contracts respectively. This places the currency pair’s implied volatility at its highest level since July 2016 and comes in response to the unknown outcome regarding the UK’s departure from the EU. 
$$$$
Although the Bank of England announced its latest Monetary Policy update earlier today, UK’s central bank remains sidelined by the latest Brexit drama.Yesterday the British Government formally submitted its request to the European Union to push back Brexit from March 29 to June 30 as the UK risks crashing out of the EU without a deal despite MPs voting against a no-deal exit.
$$$$
Now, it appears that the direction of Brexit – and the Pound – looks to be in the hands of the EU27 who are meeting in Brussels today at the EU Summit to discuss the UK’s request to extend Brexit. Great uncertainty over the decision has fueled downside pressure in the GBP considering all other 27 EU members must unanimously approve a Brexit delay. As things currently stand, the legal default is for the UK to crash out of the EU on March 29 without a Withdrawal Agreement. 
$$$$
Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets.
$$$$
The release of economic indicators out of the UK and US also look to move GBPUSD’s needle over the coming days. Tomorrow, currency traders are set to turn their eyes to PMI readings from the US which follows the Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC monetary policy decision. The Fed’s latest dovish position and lowering of its 2019 economic projections sent the US Dollar plummeting, but a healthy print on tomorrow’s PMI could help bolster the USD. 
$$$$
US and UK consumer confidence in addition to a slew of other economic data readings listed above should also be watched for any material surprises that could cause spot GBPUSD prices to oscillate. However, headlines covering the latest Brexit developments will likely overshadow economic data and dominate price action. 
$$$$
From a technical perspective, spot GBPUSD is teetering at support from the 34-day EMA after prices fell below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement line. The next technical support levels worth eyeing are the 50.0 percent Fibonacci retracement in addition to the uptrend line extending from where prices based February 14 and March 11. Slightly below this area is the 1.3051 price line derived from 1-week implied volatility and is where currency option traders expect spot GBPUSD to stay above. 
$$$$
On the flip side, resistance could be seen where spot cable prices fell below the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement line as old support becomes new resistance. Also, additional downward pressure could be applied by 20-day SMA and 8-day EMA turning lower. 1-week implied volatility expects a price ceiling at the 1.3281 spot level. It is worth mentioning again, however, that Brexit headlines will likely dictate where spot prices head from here. 
$$$$
Check out IG’s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold, Bitcoin and S&P500. 
$$$$
Client positioning data from IG indicates that 56.5 percent of traders are net-long while the number of traders net-long is 6.9 percent higher than yesterday and 7.9 percent higher than last week. This has resulted in the highest percentage of traders net-long GBPUSD since March 14 when the cable traded near 1.3256

Q1 2019 EUR Forecast and USD Top Trading Opportunities
$$$$
The Euro continues to hold just above the 1.1300 level against the US dollar after a steady pick-up from the 21-month low of 1.1175 made one-week ago. The rise has been muted, aided by a weakening US dollar, and now may run into fundamental resistance after a report by the influential German economic institute, Ifo, pointed to a sharp slowdown in growth in Europe’s economic engine in 2019.
$$$$
According to the Ifo report, “Overall, economic growth in Germany this year is likely to slide by more than half to 0.6% compared to the previous year. Economic growth should recover to 1.8% next year; however, adjusted for calendar effects, the increase will be only 1.4% due to the higher number of working days. Consequently, Germany’s overall economic capacity utilization will continue to decline in the forecast period and reach its long-term average. This means the German economy is in a downswing”. 
$$$$
Earlier Thursday, data showed German inflation missing expectations and last month’s figures with m/m CPI at 0.4% and annual at 1.5%, both 0.1% lower than expectations. 
$$$$
EURUSD remains in a downtrend, started off the January 10 high, with a series of lower highs and lower lows visible. The pair are currently just above the 20-day moving average but below both the 50- and, more importantly, the 200-dmas. The 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.1448 should provide stiff resistance for now.

Q1 2019 EUR Forecast and USD Top Trading Opportunities
$$$$
The most actively traded fx-pair, EURUSD, continues its drift lower over the past three months with upticks providing investors with selling opportunities. Lower highs and lower lows provide visual proof that the pair continue to weaken, while last Thursday’s print of 1.1176 was the lowest price seen in the pair since late-June 2017. Yesterday’s Ifo Spring Report suggesting that German 2019 growth would fall to just 0.6% added to the general bearishness around the pair, while Euro-Zone growth in the final quarter of 2018 was recently confirmed at a mere 0.2%, after a prior quarter’s skinny 0.1%.
$$$$
Next week we have Euro-Zone sentiment indicators – ZEW on Tuesday and Markit PMIs on Friday – and another set of weak releases could see EURUSD re-testing its recent lows. Both sets of indicators are already at depressed levels, confirming current market sentiment.

GBPUSD and EURUSD overnight implied volatility jumps ahead of the latest Brexit developments and update on Eurozone’s economy
$$$$
UK employment data and ZEW’s latest Survey of Economic Sentiment expected tomorrow are likely contributing to GBP and EUR uncertainty 
$$$$

"	"
Although implied volatility across the currency market generally looks depressed relative to levels witnessed over the last few trading days, GBPUSD and EURUSD overnight options contracts are pricing in heightened price action for tomorrow. In fact, compared to Friday’s numbers, GBPUSD 1-Day implied volatility skyrocketed from 8.30 percent to 14.50 percent while EURUSD 1-Day implied volatility rose from 2.96 percent to 5.53 percent. 
$$$$
Aside from employment data expected out of the UK tomorrow, the latest Brexit development has injected additional uncertainty regarding the country’s departure from the European Union. It now looks like MPs will no longer hold a third meaningful vote on the proposed EU Withdrawal Agreement this week, dealing the most recent blow to PM May and her Brexit deal. As Speaker Bercow stated this morning, the British government cannot hold another vote on the same proposition. 
$$$$
Although the House of Commons just approved a Brexit extension last week in hopes of delaying the March 29 deadline, pushing back the date requires unanimous approval from all other 27 members of the EU. Greater uncertainty as we approach the Brexit finish line is likely bidding up GBPUSD option premium hedging costs which is reflected in the higher implied volatility. 
$$$$
The Euro will likely garner some attention from currency traders with the latest reading on economic sentiment expected to be released at 10:00 GMT tomorrow. If the report is perceived by markets as positive, EURUSD may continue its recovery back to the upside. Alternatively, further deterioration of economic sentiment in the Eurozone could put renewed pressure on the bloc’s currency. 
$$$$
Elsewhere in forex markets, overnight volatility on the New Zealand Dollar, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen nearly doubled from Friday. The uptick could be in response to NZD, AUD, and JPY having potential for sizable price swings ahead of tomorrow’s market-moving event risk. 
$$$$
GBPUSD client positioning data from IG shows that 50.4 percent of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.02 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 0.8% higher than Friday while the number of traders net-short is 10.7% lower than Friday.

The Euro is currently in vogue as ‘the cleanest shirt in the laundry basket’ as the US dollar moves lower after a dovish FOMC meeting while Sterling still struggles with a lack of leadership from UK PM Theresa May.
$$$$
Wednesday’s FOMC meeting saw the Fed downgrade economic growth and inflation forecasts and confirm that it will stop bond sales after September and taper its sales before this date. This ending earlier of the balance sheet reduction program gave the market another dovish jolt, pushing US Treasury yields lower. The 10 UST now yields 2.51%, the lowest level since January 2018, while the 30-year UST yields 2.96%, nearly 50 basis points than levels seen in October 2018. Lower bond yields feed through to a weaker currency.

"	"
The Fed is set to take the spotlight tomorrow with the FOMC expected to announce its latest interest rate decision at 18:00 GMT. While it’s largely expected that the US central bank will keep its target policy rate range unchanged at 2.25-2.50 percent, USD currency traders will likely focus their attention on Chair Jerome Powell’s follow-up commentary.
$$$$
Although overnight implied volatility has ticked higher across major USD currency pairs as option traders prepare for tomorrow’s Fed announcement, anticipation of significant price swings remain particularly low. Yet, that in turn may set the stage for significant volatility should any unexpected updates be made. This may be the case in particular if the Fed disappoints markets with a position that’s less dovish than what many market participants have hoped for. If the Fed does come out less dovish than anticipated, the greenback could very well jump higher and recover ground from its recent selloff – particularly against the Euro.

Meanwhile, the Pound Sterling should remain on every currency trader’s radar despite the fall in GBPUSD implied volatility. Headlines with the latest Brexit developments could send spot markets gyrating as great uncertainty surrounding the UK’s departure from the European Union remains. Additionally, pressure in inflation statistics could add fuel to the fire that may force the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates – especially with other economic indicators surprising to the upside. 
$$$$
NZDUSD may experience larger than expected price swings in particular as it faces confluence of a Fed policy update followed shortly by New Zealand GDP data. If NZ economic growth comes in materially above or below consensus, NZDUSD could be prompted to break free from its tight trading range. According to real-time IG client positioning data, NZDUSD trader sentiment shows a bearish bias headed into tomorrow’s session. Specifically, the data shows that 42.8 percent of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at -1.33 to 1.

The Euro fell sharply Friday after the preliminary IHS Markit PMIs pointed to Q1 GDP growth of just 0.2% in the Euro-Zone, due largely to a sharp contraction in manufacturing activity.

Commenting on the flash Euro-Zone PMI data, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: “The eurozone economy ended the first quarter on a soft note, with the flash PMI running at one of the lowest levels seen since 2014. The survey indicates that GDP likely rose by a modest 0.2% in the opening quarter, with a decline in manufacturing output in the region of 0.5% being offset by an expansion of service sector output of approximately 0.3%”.

The latest ‘Monetary Policy in the Euro Area’ speech by ECB President Mario Draghi in Frankfurt earlier today continues to warn of below target inflation and uncertainty in the global economy. President Draghi highlighted that weakness in world trade has continued, significantly affecting the manufacturing sector, with industrial production in the area falling by 4.2% on the year to December, its largest decline since 2013. Draghi ended his speech by reinforcing his commitment to boost price pressures, saying that the ECB will adopt all the monetary policy actions ‘that are necessary to achieve its objective’, adding that the central bank is ‘not short of instruments to deliver on our mandate’.
$$$$
This recognition of the current low growth/inflation outlook in the Euro Area will push back any monetary policy tightening further back into 2020 and, in extremis, leaves renewed monetary policy loosening on the table.

EURUSD continues to drift lower and is within one cent of the 22-month low made on March 7 this year. The chart shows six lower highs in a row, discounting Sunday’s candle, while the pair remain firmly under all three moving averages. The 200-day moving average has acted as strong resistance three times in 2019. The downtrend from the start of the year is intact with the only supportive technical signal coming from the CCI indicator which is nearing the oversold (-100) zone.

The currency market has seen an influx of price action since last week’s implied volatility report as a whirlwind of central bank decisions, economic data releases and Brexit headlines sent major forex pairs gyrating. Currency option traders have bid up hedging costs across the market and is reflected by rising 1-week implied volatilities. With volatility ticking higher in addition to threatening event risk on deck, what currency pairs are likely to see heightened price action for the week ahead?
$$$$
It should come as no surprise that implied volatility on GBP currency pairs remains elevated considering the latest Brexit uncertainty that has sent spot Sterling prices swinging. In fact, GBPUSD 1-week implied volatility was at its highest level in 32-months yesterday. Implied volatility on the Pound has skyrocketed as Brexit approaches the finish line. With the European Council’s offer yesterday to delay the UK’s departure until April 12 at least, GBPUSD traders will likely turn their attention to London where British MPs look to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit Withdrawal Agreement for a third time next week.
$$$$
EURUSD is another currency pair worth keeping an eye on as the Eurozone and US will both release inflation data which could inject some extra spot price volatility. The Euro has traded in a narrow range against the US Dollar for the last several months, but the continued coiling between rising and falling trendlines has wedged EURUSD into a tight channel that could easy break if sparked by the right catalyst. 
$$$$
Extraordinarily weak PMI data out of the two areas released earlier today seem to have renewed economic growth concerns and pushed the EURUSD lower. However, a speech from ECB President Mario Draghi slated for next Wednesday could bolster confidence for Euro-bulls. Implied volatility from the 1-week EURUSD options contract suggests a high of 1.1330 and a low of 1.1258 and could be potential levels to watch for spot prices to rebound. 
$$$$
The Japanese Yen has also garnered some attention recently after forex traders reacted to a dovish Federal Reserve who lowered forecasts for economic growth and employment while also announcing an end to balance sheet normalization by September. This sparked a massive selloff in USDJPY post-FOMC on Wednesday as investors flocked into the anti-risk JPY. 
$$$$
USDJPY appears to have fallen through support at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci line but since bounced off today’s low. The extended upward-sloping trendline drawn from January’s flash crash low to today’s intraday bottom looks to provide the next near-term area of support. Although, currency option traders expect spot USDJPY to remain between 110.4565 and 109.7235 judging by 1-week implied volatility. That being said, upcoming data releases in addition to general market sentiment will likely dictate the currency pair’s next direction. 
$$$$
Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets. 
$$$$
As for the USDCAD, 1-week implied volatility has escalated ahead of Canadian GDP expected next Friday. This high-impact indicator could stir price action for the Canadian Dollar depending on how the actual data print compares to economic estimates. With global growth concerns seemingly re-entering the market, oil could serve as a bellwether to the Loonie’s next direction considering the high correlation between spot CAD and oil prices. 
$$$$
Moreover, after today’s weak inflation reading out of Canada, the country’s relatively hawkish central bank could be sidelined by tame inflation and a moderating economy.  After USDCAD spot prices broke above the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement line, resistance now looks to the downtrend formed between the high at the beginning of the year and where the forex pair peaked in March. The 1-week implied high derived from USDCAD currency options suggests prices topping out at 1.3441 while 1.3361 is calculated as the 1-week implied low.

GBPUSD overnight implied volatility has jumped to its highest level since November 15 as forex option traders price in the latest Brexit uncertainty. Increasing implied volatility reflects higher ‘insurance’ costs for GBPUSD currency traders who utilize options to hedge their positions and reflects the market’s view that spot prices could experience significant swings over the contract’s respective duration. 
$$$$
Prime Minister Theresa May still faces an uphill battle to get her Brexit deal passed through the House of Commons as British MPs remain opposed to supporting the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with the EU. Parliament has previously rejected the Brexit deal twice and has led the UK government to request an extension to Article 50 in a last-minute attempt to save Brexit.
$$$$
The European Council agreed to delay Brexit until April 12, but the new deadline is contingent on the UK approving the Brexit deal on the table – a deal that is not open for further negotiations according to EUCO President Donald Tusk. Moreover, the so-called Strasbourg Agreement offered by the EU to extend the March 29 Brexit deadline is not legally binding and is contingent on the UK to approving the Brexit deal. In other words, the UK is still largely at risk of a ‘hard’ no-deal Brexit departure from the EU this Friday.  
$$$$
Check out this Brexit Timeline for key events driving the UK’s departure from the EU
$$$$
The struggle continues for Theresa May as she keeps fighting for enough Parliamentary support to secure a Brexit deal this week. Despite the PM’s efforts to get majority backing for her Brexit deal, she has just announced to Parliament that “there is not sufficient support in the Commons to bring back the Withdrawal Agreement for a third meaningful vote.” 
$$$$
PM May added to her statement that the government will oppose the Letwin Amendment but will still provide time for Parliament to vote on it tonight around 22:00 GMT. The motion could provide MPs with options over the direction of Brexit that has potential to pass with majority. Although, as things stand currently, it increasingly appears that only 2 choices remain for Brexit: revoke Article 50 and stop Brexit or depart the EU with no deal.

German exports continue to suffer and business confidence among German exporters has 'clearly deteriorated' according to the latest ifo export expectations survey released earlier today. The export expectations in manufacturing fell to the lowest value since October 2012, with the slowdown in the global economy cited. According to ifo President Clemens Fuest, ‘After the caution expressed in the previous month, export expectations in the automotive industry have weakened considerably, and declines in exports are expected. The same applies to the metals industry. No further growth in exports is foreseen in the mechanical engineering sector, but also no further declines. The chemical industry remains well positioned in foreign business and anticipates additional orders. The electrical industry also expects growth’.

Another set of weak PMI prints in the Euro-Zone with the March final releases missing already weak preliminary results. Ongoing weakness in the manufacturing space has weighed on the single currency in the past few weeks and today’s results will only add to thoughts that the Euro-Zone may need a helping hand from the ECB to re-start the economy. Wednesday’s final services and composite PMIs will now be watched closely for further signs of economic weakness. In addition, the latest inflation numbers for the single-block also missed target with core CPI y/y falling to 0.8% from 1.0% in February while headline CPI nudged 0.1% lower to 1.4% y/y.

The bad economic news did little to dampen the Euro in early turnover with EURUSD posting small gains, helped in part by a slightly weaker US dollar.

EURUSD has found support around 1.1200 and may take a run at the 1.1260-1.1280 area. The pair is edging out of oversold territory and while the chart remains bearish in the longer-term, a re-test of 1.1300 cannot be discounted.

Brexit remains in limbo after the latest developments from British Parliament and leaves the situation more clouded than ever. Consequently, forex options traders are pricing 17.4 percent implied volatility on overnight GBPUSD contracts due to the exceptional degree uncertainty. 
$$$$
After Prime Minister Theresa May offered to resign in exchange for MP support over her Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, Parliament showed how divided British politicians remain over the UK’s departure from the EU with all 8 motions suggesting alternative Brexit paths failing to gain majority backing. It now appears that the House of Commons will hold a third meaningful vote over the PM’s Brexit deal tomorrow at 2:30 PM London time which increasingly seems like the only viable option left for the UK unless MPs plan on pulling out of the EU with no deal. 
$$$$
Also, USDCAD overnight implied volatility also looks relatively elevated with Canadian GDP numbers expected to cross the wires at 12:30 GMT tomorrow. Strong correlation between the Canadian Dollar and oil prices could also be factoring into USDCAD’s uptick in implied volatility following US President Trump’s latest criticism of OPEC supply cuts and high oil prices. Additionally, other market-moving economic data on deck like US inflation could cause the currency pair to gyrate.

The pattern of lower highs, and lower lows to date, highlight the weakness of the single currency against a resurgent US dollar. The pair hit a recent peak around 1.1450 less than two weeks ago before the bearish longer-term pattern reasserted itself, prompting the pair to fall sharply lower. The speed of the recent fall has pushed EURUSD into oversold territory using the CCI at the bottom of the chart, and this may see a small bounce in the pair within a longer-term bearish pattern. This, potential, short-term pullback may also be aided by the recent breakdown in this pattern of lower highs – the pattern was broken on March 20 while the lower low pattern is still in place. This may see the pair range trade in the short-term, again offering the opportunity for a small technical retracement.

Key events to watch for are the latest Consumer Price Index reading from Germany in addition to employment, industrial production and retail numbers out of Japan. Germany is expected to report a 1.5 percent year-over-year increase in its CPI – a print higher than consensus could put upward pressure on the Euro since higher inflation has potential to erode the ECB’s recent dovish position. Similarly, the Yen could take a dive If Japanese data disappoints and comes in below estimates.

EURJPY currency traders might expect the forex pair to trade between a range of 123.704 and 124.876 which creates a band 1 standard deviation away from spot prices using overnight implied volatility. Recent Eurozone weakness and riskaversion has sent forex traders flocking into the Japanese Yen and has resulted in a short-term downtrend for the EURJPY cross and is worth keeping an eye on for signs of continuation or a potential reversal higher. 
$$$$
The uptrend line formed from the low on March 22 and today has pushed spot EURJPY into a tight coil, however, and leaves the recent consolidation looking prime for a breakout. Drawing a Fibonacci retracement from March’s high and low points puts the 23.6 percent and 0.0 percent Fibs as potential short-term targets.

Crude Oil Prices Plunge After Trump Tweet Bashes OPEC Supply Cuts	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/03/28/crude-oil-prices-plunge-after-trump-tweet-bashes-opec-supply-cuts.html	1553792400	"
President Trump stated the price of oil is getting too high in his latest market-moving tweet calling on OPEC to increase supply after recent production cuts 
$$$$
Crude oil has risen roughly 30 percent so far this year with prices now flirting with the $60/bbl area – its highest level since November 2018

President Trump tweeted this morning that it’s “very important that OPEC increase the flow of Oil” which sent crude prices tumbling lower. Trump’s remarks were not the first time he’s voiced his opinion that oil prices are too high. 
$$$$
Check out these Crude Oil Facts every trader should know!
$$$$
OPEC agreed to cut its supply of oil after prices collapsed through the fourth quarter of 2018 in response to shrinking demand for the commodity amid slowing global growth. Crude oil prices have since surged over 40 percent to $60/bbl after bottoming around $42/bbl in December. Although, risks of a slowing global economy remains a burden which is reflected by the latest downward revisions to GDP growth forecasts and plummeting sovereign yields. 
$$$$
On that point, President Trump also stated that ‘world markets are fragile’ in his tweet. The President of the United States has a history of chiming in on market performance, especially when it comes to stocks and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. As such, it appears that POTUS is looking to jawbone growth-favorable turns attemping to boost the equity index higher with positive US-China trade war news – or alternatively talk down high oil prices which can increase costs across the economy as is the case today. 
$$$$
That being said, OPEC likely will disregard Trump’s comments with the oil cartel independently deciding their production plans. OPEC was supposed to convene to discuss oil output in April, but have since canceled the meeting as the group and its allies remain in agreement to hold production cuts at 1.2 million barrels per day.
$$$$
However, Russia’s Gazprom Neft, one of the important non-OPEC oil producing stalwarts, stated it does not expect to continue the previously agreed upon supply cuts through the end of 2019. This news could be adding further downward pressure on oil prices today thus exacerbating the move lower in Crude following Trump's tweet. But, prices look to remain steady above $58/bbl as OPEC output decisions vastly outweigh non-OPEC members in terms of relative impact on the global supply of oil. 
$$$$
Check out IG’s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold, Bitcoin and S&P500. 
$$$$
According to IG client positioning data, 49.1 percent of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at -1.04 to 1 with crude oil traders appearing like they are growing increasingly bearish considering the number of traders net-long falling 3.3 percent compared to last week.

XAUUSD: Spot Gold Price Chart Suggests Further Pullback Risk	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/01/xauusd-spot-gold-price-chart-suggests-further-pullback-risk.html	1554141600	"
Gold prices now rest below support at the $1,300 level after sustained downward pressure since topping out mid-February at the $1,345 area, which puts XAUUSD at risk for additional downside
$$$$
Markets may continue to overlook gold in the short-term as risk-on sentiment gains momentum on the back of rebounding yields, improving economic data
$$$$

"	"
Gold appears to have lost some of its luster over the last month and a half with XAUUSD selling off nearly 4 percent since spot prices peaked mid-February. Now, gold sits below technical support at the $1,300 price level which could put the precious metal at risk for further short-term downside. 
$$$$
With spot gold’s latest plunge, prices could extend even lower towards the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement line to find support around $1,280. Aside from the bearish technical picture, rebounding yields could further exacerbate gold’s recent weakness. 
$$$$
Gold failed to mirror the anti-risk rally in Treasuries over the second half of March which was largely triggered by the Federal Reserve announcing its latest dovish position and downward revisions to economic growth forecasts. The decline in the US 10-Year Treasury yield from 2.76 percent at the beginning of last month down to 2.36 percent on March 27 – its lowest level since December 18, 2017 – has since rebounded sharply back to 2.49 percent. 
$$$$

$$$$
Recent manufacturing data out of China and the US could be sparking the latest risk-on rally after both countries showed improvement. Consequently, the latest economic readings may suggest that fears of slowing global growth are overdone which in turn could push yields higher and gold prices lower considering their inverse relationship. That being said, the short-term uptrend line formed by the lows in spot gold on March 7 and March 29 could provide technical support. 
$$$$
Check out IG’s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold, Bitcoin and S&P500. 
$$$$
According to spot gold client positioning data from IG, 76.9 percent of traders are net long resulting in a ratio of traders long to short of 3.32 to 1. Despite the dip in XAUUSD from the $1,320 price level, spot gold traders have increased their bullish bias with the number of traders net-long rising 7.5 percent relative to last week.

Currency Volatility: RBA Could Jolt AUDUSD Price Action	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/04/01/currency-volatility-rba-could-jolt-audusd-price-action.html	1554158700	"
AUDUSD overnight implied volatility skyrockets to 10.7 percent in anticipation of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s rate review expected Tuesday at 3:00 GMT 
$$$$
Although markets are largely expecting the RBA to keep interest rates on hold at 1.50 percent, Governor Philip Lowe could provide supplemental information on the central bank’s latest view on monetary policy and economic outlook

"	"
Forex option traders have bid up implied volatility on overnight AUDUSD contracts ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia’s latest monetary policy decision slated for Tuesday at 3:00 GMT. While the central bank is widely expected to stay on the sidelines and leave its policy interest rate unchanged at 1.50 percent, follow-up commentary from Governor Lowe looks to provide AUD traders with additional insight on the RBA’s next move. 
$$$$
The accompanying monetary policy decision statement will likely highlight the latest developments in Australia’s labor and housing markets which largely contribute to the central bank’s relative dovish or hawkish tilt. Despite the Australian unemployment rate recently dropping to 4.9 percent, its lowest reading since June 2011, the RBA could still refrain from taking a less-dovish stance in consideration of neighboring New Zealand whose central bank hinted at cutting the country's policy interest rate last week.
$$$$
AUDUSD spot prices have recently traded between the 23.6 percent and 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement lines drawn from March’s low and high. Although, the currency pair appears to have coiled between short-term trendlines which could position AUDUSD for a material break above downtrend resistance or below uptrend support. According to overnight implied volatility measures, however, currency market participants could expect AUDUSD to trade between 0.7076 and 0.7156. 
$$$$
Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a comprehensive list of upcoming economic events and data releases affecting the global markets. 
$$$$
In addition to the RBA’s rate review, a handful of economic data out of Australia and the US could exacerbate AUDUSD price volatility. The latest reading on US Durable Goods Orders could move the market’s needle if actual data crosses the wires materially above or below consensus. Also, AiG’s Performance of Services Index has potential to send AUDUSD gyrating later in Tuesday’s session depending on the reading. 
$$$$
Check out IG’s Client Sentiment here for more detail on the bullish and bearish biases of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, Gold, Bitcoin and S&P500. 
$$$$
According to IG’s client positioning data, 61.3 percent of AUDUSD traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.59 to 1. Moreover, traders have grown increasing bullish AUDUSD as the number of traders net-long is 11.4 percent higher than Friday and 26.9 percent higher compared to last week. However, we typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment which suggests AUDUSD prices may continue to fall.

The Euro and German yields had been underpinned this morning by a slew of better than expected services PMI figures from the Eurozone. Consequently, this has eased some concerns that the weakness in the manufacturing sector is spreading to the whole economy, given the pick up in the services data. However, while the manufacturing sector remains weak the upside in the Euro remains somewhat limited, as such, any sizeable move to the upside should be treated with caution. Risks to the Euro-Area continue to remain tilted to the downside, while CFTC data continues to show that investors remain bearish on the Euro with net shorts valued at over $11bln.

$$$$
The increasing hope that Brexit is moving in a softer direction has been among the supportive factors behind the Euro this morning. Yesterday saw PM May reach out to the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in order to find a Brexit compromise, while also seeking an agreement with the EU on an extension to Article 50. While political uncertainty over Brexit remains high, there is a growing sense that the approach is moving to a softer direction.

German car exports to the US could fall by 50%.
$$$$
Any additional trade tariffs would weigh on the Euro.
"	"
Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
A recent report by the respected German Ifo Institute Center for Economic Studies posits that German car exports to the US could fall by 50% if America ‘were to impose permanent import duties of an additional 25%’. Ifo added that these tariffs would reduce German car exports by 7.7%, equivalent EUR18.4 billion. By Sunday, February 17, the US Department of Commerce will present a report on whether the high level of EU car imports into the US pose a threat to US national security, which may open the way for a new round of punitive tariffs. Ifo added that the EU may impose tariffs of US products to bring the economic effects of tariffs to ‘roughly zero’ although any trade war escalation will hurt both countries.
$$$$
German automobile manufacturers, including giants Daimler and Volkswagen (VW), have both seen their share price fall by 25%-30% over the last 18 months due to a diesel scandal that has rocked the industry. Back in September 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency accused VW of fitting illegal monitoring systems to its cars to manipulate emission readings.

This weekend’s ruling comes at a bad time for Germany and the EU with data showing German Q4 growth flat q/q while the EU grew by a miserly 0.2% in the same reporting period.

EURUSD is now battling to make a clean break and close back above 1.1300, an area that has acted as support over the past few months. To the downside, Wednesday’s low at 1.1248 was re-tested and rejected, just, on Thursday and may fall if the US look to impose tariffs. While the pair are nearing oversold territory, there is still room to fall further, while all three moving averages block any attempt to regain the 1.1500 level.

Euro particularly sensitive amid declining economic performance
"	"
See our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy!
$$$$The Euro may have a painful fall tomorrow if quarter-on-quarter German and Eurozone GDP falls short of expectations. Current forecasts stand at 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. Euro Area growth has been dramatically slowing and major economic indicators continue to underperform relative to economists’ expectations as shown by the Citi Economic Surprise Index. $$$$ If data continues to disappoint and the outlook for EUR/USD continues to look gloomier in the face of growing political obstacles, it is likely the Euro will continue to feel pain. As it stands, the three largest Eurozone economies – Germany, France and Italy – are all struggling to keep up steam, with the last one only recently having entered a technical recession. $$$$As risk aversion turns investor’s optimism sour, the spread between Italian and German 10-year bond yields has widened over 100 percent since May, signaling greater trepidation in lending to Rome vs Berlin. The shifting political landscape is also weighing down on the Euro. The decline of Europhile liberals combined with rising Eurosceptics ahead of the European Parliamentary elections is also concerning. $$$$
Spread on Italian-German 10-Year Bond Yields
$$$$Looking ahead, the Euro will struggle to maintain any significant upward momentum following yesterday’s disappointing industrial production data. Following the release, EUR/USD dropped and closed below 1.1269 with the next possible support at 1.1216. Given the fundamental outlook, it is difficult to say with confidence that the Euro has much room for upward momentum considering the many hurdles it must overcome in 2019. $$$$

German economic growth flat in Q4.
$$$$
EURUSD nearing lows last seen in June 2017.

Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
Further evidence that the Euro-Zone is facing a tough few months ahead with data released earlier today showing the German economy stalling in the last quarter of 2018 and narrowly avoiding recessionary territory. German statistics bureau Destatis reported German Q4 GDP at 0.0%, after a -0.2% reading in Q3, while the economy expanded by 0.9% on the same quarter a year ago, missing expectations of 1.1% growth.
$$$$
Germany’s economy, especially the export space, has been hit by a toxic cocktail of slowing global growth, the diesel scandal that rocked the automobile sector, Brexit worries and increasing fears that US trade sanctions may hit the automobile sector with a US Department of Commerce report scheduled to be released on February 17.
$$$$
Later this morning we will get the first look at Q4 Euro-Zone GDP with expectations now for just 0.1% q/q growth, down from 0.2%, and 1.1% annualized growth, down from 1.2%.
$$$$
EURUSD continues to drift lower and is looking for a clean break and close below the 1.1280 - 1.1300, an area that has provided strong support over the last few months. If we close and consolidate below here, 1.1300 may well become a new resistance level, leaving the pair vulnerable to a re-test of the November 12 low at 1.1215 ahead of a further fall to the 1.1106 – 1.1117 lows printed all the way back in June 2017.

The Eurozone economy expanded by just 0.2% quarter/quarter in the final three months of 2018 and by a mere 1.2% year/year.
$$$$
The poor data will do little to prop up EURUSD, which has been weakened by a stronger US Dollar.

Economic growth in the Eurozone was a miserly 0.2% quarter/quarter in the final three months of 2018, leaving year/year GDP growth at just 1.2%, according to the latest data.
$$$$
The figures followed news that the German economy failed to expand at all in the fourth quarter, while Italy fell into a technical recession. Now, it seems likely that growth in the Eurozone this year could be as low as 1%.
$$$$
In the meantime, the Euro could well weaken further given the political problems in Spain and negative German government bond (Bund) yields right up to nine-year-maturity debt. Here’s how EURUSD reacted to the latest numbers:

Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.

After touching a low just above 1.1255 on Tuesday, the lowest level since mid-November, EURUSD has rallied back to around 1.1320, making a third higher high in a row. The pair are currently being moved around by the US dollar, although EU and German data on Thursday will likely take over the wheel and steer the pair going into the end of the week. 
$$$$
German q/q GDP is released early Thursday morning and is expected to show growth of a miserly 0.1% in Q4, although some in the market are speculating that the reading may be flat for the quarter. German Q3 GDP rocked the market at -0.2% and 2019 German growth is now expected to be just 1%, down from expectations around 1.7% late last year. A slowing global economy, ongoing gloom in the auto industry and fears that a hard Brexit will impact German exporters hard have all added to the slowdown and will likely remain so over the coming months.
$$$$
DailyFX Calendar
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment data currently shows retail are 70.4% net-long EURUSD, a bearish contrarian indicator. However, the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a mixed EURUSD trading bias.
$$$$
EURUSD remains negative overall, trading well below all three moving averages and just above the 1.1300 area that seems to currently be stemming further losses. If we break and close below 1.1215, a level last seen in June 2017, further losses are likely. Option expires at 1.1350/5 and 1.1375 may also cap upside movement in the short-term. One caveat – the 1.1300 barrier continues to produce reversals with talk that central banks are active around this level. However, a resurgent US dollar and weak data on Thursday may test these buyers resolve and finally see the single currency break lower.

Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
EURUSD is on its way to re-test the 1.1300 area as a combination of a weak Euro and a strong US dollar push the pair lower. EURUSD traded as high as 1.1460 on Monday before fading lower, leaving a chart with five red candles in a row this week. Yet the 1.1300 area has held firm over the last three months, aside from the mid-November sell-off and sharp reversal and is likely to prove strong support as we head into the weekend. Retail sentiment suggests that lower prices lie ahead while the RSI indicator is nearing oversold conditions and is at the lowest level since mid-November. If we break and close below 1.1300, a further sell-off to the 1.1260-1.1270 level should ensue before the previously mentioned November sell-off low at 1.12158.
$$$$
Overall the technical set-up remains negative with eight daily lower highs in a row and with the pair below all three moving averages, yet support has proved robust since late-October and history may well repeat itself.
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment data currently show retail are 65.1% net-long EURUSD, a bearish contrarian indicator. In addition, traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger EURUSD bearish contrarian trading bias.

EUR/USD Outlook: Possible Spain Election Reinforces Trend Lower	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/02/12/EURUSD-Outlook-Possible-Spain-Election-Reinforces-Trend-Lower.html	1549965600	"
EUR/USD is weakening, principally on US Dollar strength.
$$$$
However, the possibility of a snap parliamentary election in Spain this year will likely reinforce Euro weakness.
"	"
Spain’s minority government faces a vote on its 2019 budget Wednesday, and failure to approve it could lead to a snap parliamentary election this year – potentially reinforcing the slide lower in the Euro caused principally by US Dollar strength.
$$$$
USD has been bolstered in recent days by optimism that another partial US government shutdown can be avoided and hopes of progress in the US-China trade talks. That has sent EUR/USD to its lowest level since November 13 last year.
$$$$

$$$$
In the near term, a bounce higher in EUR/USD is feasible as the pair nears oversold territory. However, looking further ahead, the Spanish government faces problems as a trial of 12 Catalan secessionist leaders begins Tuesday, with the defendants charged for their role in a failed independence bid 16 months ago.

The minority Spanish government faces a vote on its 2019 budget Wednesday but the Catalan parties it needs to support it look likely to withhold their support, with failure to pass the budget likely to prompt a snap parliamentary election later this year, with April 14 cited as a possible date.
$$$$
This political uncertainty could weaken EUR/USD, which faces critical support at the November 12 low of 1.1216. If that fails to hold, the pair will be back to levels last seen in June 2017, with little further support for EUR/USD before the June 20, 2017 low at 1.1119.
$$$$
Moreover, retail trader sentiment data suggest a bearish outlook, with 71% of traders net long and only 29% short. At DailyFX, we typically take a contrarian view of crowd sentiment and the fact retail traders are net long suggests the EUR/USD price may continue to fall.

DailyFX Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts for EUR 
$$$$
In recent weeks, the Euro has continued to hover around the lower bound of its 1.12-1.16 range, having last week hit lows of 1.1235. In light of the slowdown in the Eurozone, particularly stemming from Germany, ECB officials have provided a cautious rhetoric, with the talk of potential TLTROs being used in order to ease downside pressures. Alongside this, the ECB’s Chief Economist highlighted that staff projections were likely to be downgraded at the March 7th rate decision, while rate guidance could be adapted (potentially extended) if the Euro Area were to slow more sharply. As it stands, money markets attach a 42% chance of a 10bps rate hike by the year-end. Amid the persistent moderation in Eurozone growth, German bund yields have continued to drop with the 10yr at 0.1%, a move to negative territory may provide a downside break of the range that EURUSD has held since October.

$$$$
Another cause of concern for the Euro is the potential introduction of EU auto tariffs. On Sunday, the US Commerce completed their investigation into whether EU autos and parts pose a threat to national security. So far, details of the findings have yet to be disclosed, while President Trump has until May 20th on whether to impose tariffs. If tariffs were to be invoked, German autos would feel the largest impact from the decision, consequently, weighing on the Euro and the DAX.
$$$$

$$$$
Among the factors that may come to the rescue for the Euro is the recent breakdown in correlation with US/DE rate differentials. While this continues to remain in favour for the USD, the spread has noticeably tightened since the peak seen in Q4 2018. Convergence could provide support for the Euro relative to USD.

Euro Vulnerable to German ZEW Survey, Italy Industrial Orders?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/02/19/EURO-Vulnerable-to-German-ZEW-Survey-Italy-Industrial-Orders.html	1550550600	"

EURO TALKING POINTS – EUR/USD, GERMAN ZEW SURVEY, ITALY INDUSTRIAL ORDERS
$$$$
See our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy!
$$$$
The Euro may slide if Germany’s ZEW Survey – a measure used to gauge the expectation for economic growth – falls short of the already-negative 13.6 forecast. The currency may also face additional downward pressure if Italian industrial orders data indicates growth is weaker than expected. Because Italy is in a technical recession, every underperforming report will likely only compound risk aversion toward Italian assets. 
$$$$
Doubt over the underlying strength in the Italian economy – and European growth – is seen by the spread between Italian and German bond yields. Since April, the spread has widened over 100 percent, especially during the battle of budgets between Rome and Brussels.
$$$$
Spread on Italian, German 10-Year Bond Yields
$$$$
However, even though German bonds are generally viewed as an anti-risk asset, recent data has revealed that not even the steam engine of European growth is immune. Seasonally adjusted quarter-on-quarter GDP came in at 0.0% percent, undershooting the 0.1 percent forecast with the previous at -0.2 percent. If the German economy contracted, it would have then satisfied the technical definition of a recession. 
$$$$
Or to put it another way, two out of the three largest Eurozone economies would each be experiencing a contraction for two consecutive quarters, with France not far behind. 
$$$$
Adding fuel to the fire, Lega Nord lawmaker – one of Italy’s ruling populist parties – sent Italian bond yields higher on Friday after he threatened Italy’s membership in the Eurozone. “[E]ither we succeed in changing Europe now or we will have to leave”, referring to the upcoming European Parliamentary elections in the spring. Eurosceptic and anti-establishment parties are gaining momentum as the voting day approaches. 
$$$$
Even though such comments from him are not unusual, markets appear to be more skittish on potential triggers that could further weigh on the outlook for growth in the EU. This primarily has to do with the ever-increasing fragility of European affairs – politically and economically. 
$$$$
Looking ahead, this week Eurozone manufacturing PMI, CPI and other typically market-moving data will be released and will likely impact EUR/USD. The ongoing Brexit negotiations is still a major risk factor with fears of a potential reignition of a US-EU trade conflict rising. 
$$$$
EUR/USD may – depending on the magnitude of the reports – flirt with 1.1269. However, a potential counter-boost may be Wednesday’s release of the FOMC meeting minutes. If the text shows a strongly dovish disposition from the Fed, it may exert downward pressure on the US Dollar and push the pair higher. Leading up to these major releases, the pair might tread water as investors hold their breath and wait for the outcomes.

EURUSD Fragility Continues After Weak German ZEW Release	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/02/19/EURUSD-Fragility-Continues-After--German-ZEW-Release-.html	1550573280	"

EURUSD remains fragile around 1.1300.
"	"
Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
The latest ZEW sentiment readings point to continued weakness in the German economy, with no pick-up expected soon. The current situation survey fell to 15 from a prior 27.6 and missed expectations of 21, while the survey expectations remained weak at -13.4 compared to January’s figure of -15.0, well below the long-term average of 22.4.
$$$$
According to ZEW President Professor Achim Wambach, ‘At the moment, we do not expect a rapid recovery of the slowing German economy. The economic situation in Germany has been weak, especially in the manufacturing sector. The figures for industrial production have once again seen a decrease, incoming orders are stagnant and foreign trade currently provides no fresh impulses. All of this is reflected in the fact that the assessment of the current situation has experienced a considerable decline. For the next six months, the financial market experts in our survey do not expect any improvement’.
$$$$
Later this week, we have the preliminary Markit PMIs released on Thursday for Germany and the EU, while on Friday we have German Ifo data.

EURUSD continues to struggle to stay above 1.1300 and may make another attempt at last Friday’s recent low at 1.1230. The pair have stayed above 1.1300 recently, aided in part by a slightly weaker US dollar, but may break lower in the near-term if data at the end of the week misses expectations.

EURUSD Little Changed as German Slowdown Continues, Focus on ECB's Draghi	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/02/22/EURUSD-Little-Changed-as-German-Slowdown-Continues-Focus-on-ECBs-Draghi.html	1550827800	"
EURUSD Unchanged Despite Soft IFO

Markets Eye Draghi Speech
"	"
EUR Analysis and Talk points
$$$$
The Euro was unchanged against the dollar and the sterling as the IFO Business Climate for February 2019 missed expectations at 98.5 (Exp. 98.9), however, the prior reading had been revised higher to 99.3 from 99.1. 
$$$$
As business climates is at its lowest since January 2015, the assessment of current conditions comes in at 103.4, its lowest since February 2013, and future expectations come in at its lowest since November 2012 at 93.8. After the release of the figures, the EURUSD has continued its scarce volatility with a marginal move as the pair continues to look for developments in the US-China trade talks to consolidate a direction. ECB President Draghi is expected to give a speech later today where he is expected to remain dovish about the likelihood of a future rate hike.
$$$$
ECB Minutes Show Policymakers Considering Fresh Stimulus, EURUSD Holds Steady
$$$$
What this figure means
$$$$
The IFO Business Climate measures business sentiment about current conditions and their expectations for the next 6 months. Constructed as the % share that are optimistic and the % share of those that are pessimistic, a higher than expected reading should be taken as a bullish sign for the euro, whilst a lower than expected figure should be taken as bearish. 
$$$$
Economic outlook
$$$$
For years Germany has been the driver of Eurozone economic growth, but after a notable slowdown in its own growth in 2018, there is no sign of a rebound in early 2019, as recent figures reveal the European economy is facing stagnation. Feared US tariffs on EU car exports could have a tough impact on Germany’s manufacturing outlook, which coupled with a global economic slowdown have led to forecasts of a 1.5 per cent growth in GDP for 2019, which would mark a second consecutive annual slowdown.
$$$$
Macroeconomic figures released in the last month have painted a mixed picture for the German economy and its future growth expectations:
$$$$
Q4 GDP figures released last week showed that Germany had narrowly missed recession at the end of 2018. The zero-growth reported followed a previous quarter contraction of 0.2%. 
$$$$
German producer price index for the month of January beat expectations but was still below the figure for December. Prices rose 2.6% in January, which beat the expectation of just a 2.20% increase, but remained below the 2.7% increase in December.
$$$$
Purchasing Manager’s Index was up to a four-month high of 52.7 backed by an increase in the services sector, coming in at 55.1, whilst manufacturing continued to decline to 47.6, staying below the 50 line that indicates a contraction in the industry. 
$$$$
EURUSD Price Struggling as PMI Data Warns of Feeble Q1 EZ Growth
$$$$
The ZEW Economic Sentiment for the month of February was revealed on Tuesday, coming in at -13.4, a slight recovery from last month’s -15, but way below its long-term average of 22.4. This figuremeasures the outlook on the economy in the next 6 months, with a value above 0 indicating a positive outlook on the economy and a value below 0 a negative value on the economy. Zew’s president Achim Wambach said “they do not expect a rapid recovery of the slowing German economy”.
$$$$
There is no doubt that the figures show that the German and European economy are facing a period of slow growth but, although many figures are seeing declines, they are not as bad as feared, as expectations for the latest economic releases have been consistently worse than actual figures released. This may be an indication that markets have braced themselves for a steeper worsening of economic conditions than the one currently unfolding, on the back of turbulent times for global economics, led mainly by the US-China tariff war and the uncertainty of Brexit.

EURUSD Fragility Continues After Weak German ZEW Release
$$$$
EURUSD PRICE CHART: 1-minute Time-Frame (Intraday)
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment – Data shows 63.1% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.71 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since Feb 04 when EURUSD traded near 1.14345; price has moved 0.8% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 0.5% higher than yesterday and 17.8% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 0.1% higher than yesterday and 15.7% higher from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EURUSD prices may continue to fall. Positioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EURUSD trading bias.

$$$$
A mixed bag of Euro-Zone PMIs with the services sector picking up and beating albeit low expectations, while the manufacturing sector, especially in Germany, fell sharply lower, adding to ECB policy makers concerns over slowing growth. There has been increased talk of late that the ECB may re-launch TLTROs sooner rather than later to help kick-start the economy.
$$$$
Commenting on the flash PMI data, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: “The Eurozone economy remained close to stagnation in February. The flash PMI lifted only slightly higher during the month, continuing to indicate one of the weakest rates of expansion since 2014. The survey data suggest that GDP may struggle to rise by much more than 0.1% in the first quarter.”
$$$$
Germany’s service sector drove an increase in overall business activity across the eurozone’s largest member state in February, according to Markit, however the country’s outwardly-focussed manufacturing sector “slipped further into contraction as export orders fell to the greatest extent for over six years”. German Ifo data, out tomorrow, will now come under even closer scrutiny.

EURO TALKING POINTS – EUR/USD, GERMAN GDP, EUROZONE CPI, EU-US TRADE CONFLICT IN SIGHT?
$$$$
See our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy!
$$$$
The Euro might be watching tomorrow’s release of German GDP amid fears of slower growth in key Eurozone economies. Both the previous report and forecast are in line at 0.0%, but there are lingering fears that Germany may report a contraction. The risk being that if the largest Eurozone economy reports negative growth for two consecutive quarters, it will have entered an official technical recession. 
$$$$
Following the GDP report, the IFO surveys – measures used to gauge sentiment for economic activity – will be released and may offer key insight on how policymakers feel about the outlook. Eurozone inflation data across various time measurements is due the same day, which may also influence the Euro. 
$$$$
Fundamental themes that (especially Euro) traders are likely to keep their eye on in the coming weeks are Brexit and trade wars. There is a possibility that the EU might be a next possible target if Trump declares victory in the US-China trade negotiations. This concern resurfaced after a report was given to the President which outlined potential security threats posed by auto imports. 
$$$$
If a tit-for-tat dispute were to erupt, it would likely push EUR/USD down and the ensuing risk aversion might propel the US Dollar up. Adding to the fun is the additional possibility of another Rome-Brussels clash over Italy’s controversial budget amid the country’s recent dip into a recession. 
$$$$
In the more immediate time frame, EUR/USD has been struggling to consistently trade above 1.1358 and may dip toward the 1.1305 support if incoming German GDP comes in negative along with disappointing Eurozone CPI. The fundamental outlook for European political economy seems to suggest any substantial upward moves are not likely to occur anytime soon.

Political problems in Spain and Italy could trap Euro bulls.
$$$$
Stagnating growth in the Eurozone is another potential snare.
$$$$
However, the downside could be limited as much of the bad news is arguably in the price already.
"	"
EURUSD has traded broadly sideways between 1.1235 and 1.1359 for nearly two weeks now but traders should keep an eye on political developments in Spain and Italy as well as growing signs of economic weakness in the Eurozone.
$$$$
Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)
$$$$
In Spain, snap Parliamentary elections called for April 28 could well result in stalemate, with all the main political parties jostling to form a ruling coalition. There is also political instability in Italy, which is currently led by a populist and Euro-skeptic Government.
$$$$
At the same time, economic growth data have shown Italy in a technical recession while Germany escaped recession by only a whisker in the final quarter of last year.
$$$$
However, this will not necessarily mean Euro weakness ahead as arguably both the Eurozone’s political and economic woes are already priced in to the EURUSD pair and Euro crosses, potentially limiting the downside.
$$$$
On the economic front, the next hurdle will be advance Eurozone consumer confidence data for February, due Wednesday at 1500 GMT. Analysts are expecting a marginal improvement in confidence to -7.7 from -7.9 in January and a worse figure than that would underline economic concerns for the bloc.

Q1 2019 EUR Forecast and Top Trading Opportunities
$$$$
The most widely traded currency pair, EURUSD, has been stuck in a rut for the last few months, with low volatility making trading decisions difficult. The pair have been in a maximum 365-pip range since mid-October 2018 despite heightened US-China trade war tensions, while the Euro-Zone economy grinds to a halt. A lack of price movement (volatility) can make it difficult to trade a pair, so we will look at a short-term trading indicator, pivot points, to see if we can identify price action within this range.
$$$$
Pivot points are widely used by short-term traders to determine where forex market sentiment may change between bullish and bearish. Pivot points are also commonly used to find likely support and resistance levels. There are a range of different pivot points that traders should study before finding which one that suits their trading style. Below are the classical hourly pivot points:

Retail traders are 57.3% net-long EURUSD according to the latest IC Client Sentiment Data, a bearish contrarian indicator. Recent changes in daily and weekly sentiment however suggest that EURUSD may soon reverse higher.

$$$$
See our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy!
$$$$
The Euro may take a hit tomorrow if French quarter-on-quarter GDP falls short of the 0.3% forecast and could be compounded if Italian confidence indicators undershoot expectations. The latter is also struggling with a technical recessionwith Germany not far behind. France’s economy – when only looking at GDP – has the strongest growth rate relative to the other two. However, to be fair, the economic bar is not exactly high. 
$$$$
The outlook for European growth for months has been declining as the IMF and ECB continued to publish grimmer forecastsas regional political fragmentation threatened the politically-fragile Euro. This in turn has put pressure on the central bank’s intention to raise rates at least once this year. Using a weighted index against the Euro, the decline of the currency relative to its counterparts suggests bullish sentiment is waning. 
$$$$
The outcome of Brexit and its potential political and economic impact on the Euro Area remains unclear with the addition of looming threats of a possible EU-US trade conflict. The upcoming European Parliamentary elections are also a source of concern. Several preliminary polls have shown a decline in the popularity of Europhile liberals with the simultaneous rise in Eurosceptic anti-establishment parties. 
$$$$
Looking ahead, PMI data out of Germany, France and Italy is scheduled to be released later in the week and could warrant the attention of Euro traders. EUR/USD may struggle to reach past 1.1415 on good news and could potentially flirt with the support at 1.1359 should economic data tomorrow disappoint.

Eurozone confidence figures released Wednesday add to the evidence that the region’s economy is struggling to expand.

Confidence in the Eurozone remained poor in February, according to the latest sentiment data from the European Commission.

The lack of growth in the Eurozone economy was emphasized earlier this month by data showing that German GDP was flat in the fourth quarter of last year after a 0.2% contraction in the third quarter. Italian figures were even worse, showing the country was in a technical recession at the end of last year after two successive quarters of negative growth.

Dow Jones Will Look to Inflation Data, Fed Expectations on Friday	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/02/28/Dow-Jones-Will-Look-to-Inflation-Data-Fed-Expectations-on-Friday.html	1551387600	"
The Dow Jones will look to Friday’s core PCE data and unemployment figures
$$$$
Financials will be an important sector to watch in Friday’s trading as inflation expectations shift and bank stocks react accordingly
$$$$
As for trading opportunities, the US Dollar may absorb the bigger impact given the nature of the data
"	"
See how IG clients are positioned on the Dow Jones, Crude oil and the US Dollar with our free IG Client Sentiment Data. 
$$$$
Friday’s US equity session may be guided by the financial sector as investors get a taste of inflation - and in turn an adjustment to rate forecasts - through the release of core PCE data. Since the equity tumble in October and December, bank stocks have lagged the broader S&P 500 as the market adapted to rate hike expectations. In turn, the lower rate expectations effectively reduced the profit potential for banks as interest rates look to remain low for longer.  
$$$$
Dow Jones price chart overlaid with ratio of S&P 500 to XLF ETF in red. Fed funds futures in blue.
$$$$
It is no surprise then that the XLF ETF, a SPDR fund that provides exposure to the US financial sector, has trailed the broader S&P 500 since late December as reflected in the ratio of SPX to XLF. The depths of December coincide with a shift in Fed Chairman Powell’s tone that subsequently saw rate hike expectations plummet. Reinforcing this under-performance, the XLF ETF notched considerable outflows around the time of the dovish shift. 
$$$$
Since October 1st, the XLF ETF has recorded nearly $5.6 billion in outflows. December alone notched roughly $3.1 billion in outflows. Apart from a huge inflow on January 2nd, the fund has come under immense selling pressure as the outlook for the financial sector shifted on the Fed’s new tone. While some of the selling is attributable to broader equity pressure, it is important to note the sustained outflows even as the broader equity market rebounded in January and February. Those months saw another $1.5 billion exit XLF. 
$$$$
That said, US economic data has been relatively strong in recent weeks. US fourth quarter GDP surprised analysts and regional data along with sentiment indicators have rebounded considerably from January. Should Friday’s core PCE data deliver a similar surprise, financials will be the sector to watch as investors gauge the data’s impact on monetary policy and the knock-on effect it could have for individual bank stocks.

$$$$
Together, the financial sector could work to buoy or pressure the Dow Jones. Similarly, the inflationary takeaways from the data could impact the Dollar to a greater extent than the Dow. Given the nature of Friday’s data and the potential for a market reaction, the US Dollar may be a more appropriate vehicle to source volatility in tomorrow’s session.

The Dollar has been pressured the last two weeks, retreating from 97.37 to lows around 95.80 on Thursday. Poor PCE data could spur a continuation of the recent downtrend, while a surprise to the topside could propel the Greenback to test the resistance from the recent decline highlighted in the chart above. Check out a deeper analysis of the US Dollar for different perspectives on opportunities through Friday’s session.

Tomorrow’s session looks to be a volatile one for EURUSD traders with key Eurozone and U.S. economic data due for release. Judging by the 1-Day (1D) implied volatility priced on the currency pair’s overnight options contract, trading levels should range between 1.1355 and 1.1431. Current spot EURUSD is 1.1379. 
$$$$
Overnight implied volatility has nearly doubled since last Friday from a mere 3.4 percent to 6.4 percent as forex traders prepare for potentially sizeable price moves in the EUR and USD. At the same time, the currency pair marched roughly 0.8 percent higher from a low of 1.1316 before pulling back modestly from today’s high of 1.1420.

Also, core personal consumption expenditures and the ISM’s manufacturing index are scheduled to cross the wires at 13:30 GMT and 15:00 GMT respectively with these metrics likely warranting a reaction in the USD. 
$$$$
Following today’s not-so-bad GDP numbers that beat estimates, further evidence of a healthy US economy may put the Federal Reserve back in the hot seat over interest rates. This could cause the US Dollar to catch bid if rate hike expectations start to rise if markets start pricing a data-dependent Fed transition from its patient wait-and-see approach back to a position of tightening. 
$$$$
The rising wedge pattern formed over the second half of this month has pushed the Euro-Dollar cross into a tight coil where prices look set to break out above trend resistance or below trend support. Consequently, is likely that tomorrow’s economic data will dictate the forex pair’s next direction.

Awareness of implied volatility aids forex traders in predicting the possible magnitude of spot price movements. Expected volatility can be used to calculate trading ranges that provides an estimate for how high or low a currency might move over the given period which is useful for hedging and setting effective limit orders. So what is the forex option market expecting next week for NZDUSD, AUDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, USDJPY, GBPUSD and EURUSD? 
$$$$
The drawdown in 1-week implied volatilities over the last few trading days could be signaling a ‘calm before the storm.’ Weak economic data that has been crossing the wires as of late could eventually turn sentiment and quickly accelerate price action. This generally causes volatility to spike.

AUDUSD looks ripe for some price action on Tuesday with the Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate decisionand Governor Lowe’s follow-up speech. Although markets are widely expecting the RBA to keep the cash target rate on hold at 1.5 percent, the central bank’s leader may provide insight on the future direction of Australia’s monetary policy. The ISM Services Index could also impact the currency pair if the reading warrants a reaction in the USD which follows a disappointing report on the manufacturing sector released earlier today.
$$$$
Additionally, USDCAD could see some sizeable swings with the Bank of Canada slated to announce any changes in its interest rate outlook with the accommodating press release providing a check-up on the country’s economy. Friday could also bring about some volatility for USDCAD traders with employment data out of the two countries on deck for release.

$$$$
Leading up to the release of Italy’s GDP, EUR/USD may be on its toes as traders anxiously wait to see if the third largest Eurozone economy will report a third consecutive quarter of economic contraction. Composite and services PMI data from Italy and Germany will also be in focus. This comes as preliminary estimates for the latter’s quarter-on-quarter GDP growth came in at 0.0 percent, with the previous showing a contraction. 
$$$$
Since April, Italy’s quarter-on-quarter GDP has been sharply declining with the country recently entering a technical recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. If the economy continues to shrink, policymakers in Brussels may urge Rome to revise its already-watered down controversial budget that rocked markets in 2018. The Euro took a hit from it and entered 2019 in a downtrend and has been moving sluggishly.  
$$$$
There is also a lingering concern that another US-EU conflict may erupt if President Trump decides to place tariffs on auto imports following the report he received from the Commerce Department. European officials have taken this potential threat seriously and announced they are ready to retaliate with similar measures against Caterpillar Inc, a US industrial giant. This would undoubtably push the already-battered Euro down. 
$$$$
EUR/USD – Daily Chart 
$$$$
Looking ahead, markets will be closely watching the upcoming ECB rate decision on Thursday. While it is expected the central bank will keep rates on hold, what markets will likely care about are the comments that will follow from ECB President Mario Draghi. If the outlook for inflation and growth are further revised downward – in addition to potentially poor Italian GDP – it may send EUR/USD down toward 1.1269.

EURUSD is looking weak technically.
$$$$
From a fundamental perspective, price action this week will likely be dominated by Thursday’s ECB monetary policy meeting.
"	"
EURUSD has broken below the support line of a bearish rising wedge pattern on the charts ahead of Thursday’s monetary-policy announcement by the European Central Bank.
$$$$
Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)
$$$$
As the chart above shows, it is now not far from the psychologically important 1.13 level, and a further fall to that point would be no surprise.
$$$$
Meanwhile, from a fundamental perspective, this week’s big event is Thursday’s monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt of the ECB’s Governing Council. It is expected to leave its key interest rates – and its forward guidance on rates – unchanged so attention will likely focus on possible downgrades of its economic growth and inflation forecasts.
$$$$
Traders should also look out for any news Thursday on its Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs), its method of providing more cheap funding to banks to encourage them to boost economic activity by lending more. At present, the ECB seems unlikely to announce a new round of TLTROs but to leave open the possibility of more loans in the future: a possible bearish development.
$$$$
Ahead of that, Tuesday’s final data on the Eurozone purchasing managers’ indexes in February showed a larger-than-expected increase in the composite PMI: up to 51.9 from 51.0 in January and above the “flash” reading of 51.4. However, that still suggests first-quarter GDP growth of just 0.2% according to IHS Markit, which compiles the figures.
$$$$
Separately, retail sales figures for the Eurozone in January beat forecasts modestly both month/month and year/year.
$$$$
On the other side of the EURUSD pair, the US Dollar is continuing to benefit from hopes of a successful US-China trade deal but talk Tuesday of a new trade dispute between the US and India could hold it back.

The overnight implied volatility on EURUSD forex option contracts exploded to its highest level since January 23 as currency markets prepare for potentially formidable price action. EURUSD traders are likely anticipating the European Central Bank’s rate review and follow-up commentary from President Mario Draghi to cause substantial price swings in the currency pair. 
$$$$
Although the ECB looks set to reiterate its zero-interest rate policy, the Eurozone’s head central banker may signal further willingness to support the bloc’s economy as downbeat data continues to disappoint. A tone that is interpreted as relatively dovish could put pressure on the Euro and send the currency to multi-week lows against the USD. 
$$$$
Visit the DailyFX Economic Calendar for a full list of data releases and event risks that impactUSD, GBP, CAD, JPY, AUD, CNY, EUR, CHF, NZD and MXN currencies.

Markets will also eye final readings on Eurozone employment and GDP numbers. Fresh job data out of the US in addition to the country’s consumer credit report should is likely on the radar as well. 
$$$$
EURUSD spot prices evidently coiled into a symmetrical triangle pattern between the currency pair’s February high and low. A breakout would suggest a continuation of the longer-term downtrend. EURUSD’s one-day trading range derived from overnight implied volatility implies that prices will likely remain between the 1.1376 and 1.1260 handles.

The Euro took a hit yesterday after the ECB announced it intends to hold rates throughout the rest of the year and plans to introduce liquidity provisions to counter the EU economic slowdown. EUR/USD plunged through the support at 1.1269 and broke through a key psychological barrier at 1.1216, the lowest point since June 2017. 
$$$$
EUR/USD – Daily Chart 
$$$$
EUR/USD – Weekly Chart
$$$$
The ECB cut its inflation forecast for 2019 from 1.6 percent to 1.2 with central bank President Mario Draghi saying the risks to the economic outlook still remain tilted on the downside. This comes shortly after seasonally adjusted year-on-year GDP came in at 1.1 percent, undershooting the 2.2 forecast. As expected, Draghi also cited the increasing risk and uncertainty stemming from a shift in European geopolitics. 
$$$$
The upcoming German factory orders data is therefore important to monitor because it will serve as a key gauge to determine how producers in the largest Eurozone economy feel about the economic outlook. Forecasts are currently pegged at 0.5 percent with the previous showing a contraction of 1.6. Italian month-on-month industrial production may also warrant the attention of Euro traders because it may illuminate the level of demand in the recession-burdened economy. 
$$$$
Looking ahead, on the external front, policymakers will continue to watch for key risks from abroad such as the trade war negotiations between Washington and Beijing, the EU’s potential economic conflict with the US and slower growth in China. At home, EU officials will be monitoring the situation with Brexit and closely eyeing the political landscape as the continent approaches its most consequential EU-wide election to date.

Asia Pacific stocks were broadly lower Friday, with the Shanghai Composite down nearly 3% on the day thanks to very weak Chinese trade data.
$$$$
Exports shrank by 20.7% in February in US Dollar terms, a far deeper fall than the 5.2% expected and the worst showing for three years. Even allowing for distortions related to the long Chinese New Year break this looks like yet another very feeble set of numbers from the world’s second largest economy. What’s more they came only hours after the European Central Bank cut eurozone growth forecasts and put more stimulus on the table, and Wall Street stocks heading lower on mounting global-economic concerns. 
$$$$
Given all of the above it’s hardly surprising that Asian equity found Friday tough. The Nikkei 225 shed 2.5%, with the ASX 200 down 1% and the Hang Seng off by 1.50%. Shanghai stocks had the worse of it though. The were down 2.90% just ahead of their close. 
$$$$
The Euro remained under pressure from Thursday’s ECB decision, with the Australian Dollar lower on those China trade worries. The US Dollar was also down a little against a basket of its major traded rivals, with the Japanese Yen catching its usual haven bid. 
$$$$
EUR/USD is now down to lows not seen since mid-2017, with the strong daily-chart downtrend channel seen since September 2018 very much entrenched.

Crude oil prices slipped on those same economic concerns, with the bulls cause not helped by Thursday’s news of soaring US supply. Gold prices were steady, but still look set for a second straight weekly fall.

Immediate focus now will be on February’s nonfarm payroll count. It is expected to have increased by 187,000, for an unchanged unemployment rate of 3.9%, down from the previous month’s 4%.

Friday’s remaining economic data schedule also offers Canadian jobless numbers and US housing-start and building-permit figures. German factory orders figures are coming up too, but those US labor market statistics will be the main event for traders, as usual.

Although forex market implied volatility dipped as currency option traders catch their breath from the rollercoaster-ride of price action realized over the last few days of trading, the British Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen could see some sizable price swings next week.
$$$$
GBPUSD will likely take the spotlight in the week ahead with Prime Minister Theresa May and British Parliament slated to hold three Brexit votes across March 12 and March 14. The UK and EU have been holding discussions over the last few days that look to extend throughout weekend as negotiators search for further assurances that can be made over the Irish backstop. 
$$$$
Without additional concessions, a second meaningful vote looks unlikely to pass the House of Commons which would set the UK on a path towards extending Article 50 and the March 29 divorce date. If the likelihood of a deal that leads to a soft-Brexit dwindles, the GBP could experience additional selling pressure. On the contrary, a deal breakthrough could very well send the Pound marching higher. 
$$$$
Currency traders will likely parse upcoming US economic data in hopes of gauging the Fed’s latest stance on monetary policy and impact on the US Dollar. Equity markets have begun to slip as investor angst re-enters the market due to a global economy that seems to keep slowing. If the trend continues, traders will likely rotate positioning from risk-on to risk-off. 
$$$$
Also noteworthy is the 1-week implied volatility for USDJPY topping its highest level in over a month ahead of BOJ’s interest rate decision and Governor Kuroda’s follow-up commentary. Traders will likely listen closely to the central banks language which comes after incredibly dovish remarks from the ECB that sent the EURUSD plummeting earlier this week. 
$$$$
GBPUSD retail client positioning shows that 64.6 percent of traders hold net-long positions headed into next week which is the highest since February 17. The ratio of long to short traders rests at 1.81 while the number of traders net-long is 19.9 percent higher from last week’s reading.
$$$$
USDJPY retail client positioning shows that 45.6 percent of traders hold net-long positions headed into next week. The ratio of short to long traders rests at -1.19 which has remained net-short since February 27. The number of traders net-long is 7.1 percent lower from last week’s reading.

Q1 2019 EUR Forecast and USD Top Trading Opportunities
$$$$
The Euro continues to edge lower ahead of the latest ECB monetary policy meeting with President Mario Draghi likely to announce further liquidity measures to help boost growth and price pressures. All policy levers will be left untouched, but Draghi is likely to outline further details for a third round of TLTROs, targeted lending that the ECB hope will help to reinvigorate the economy. The single-currency remains downbeat despite slightly better-than-expected economic data, although the outlook for the Euro-Zone remains one of slowing growth and lower-than-forecast inflation. The ECB is likely to downgrade growth and inflation forecasts, and this is expected to leave the Euro vulnerable to further weakness.

Global markets will look to commentary from the European Central Bank's President, Mario Draghi, following the group's policy decision Thursday on both interest rates and policy regarding targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs). While no change in rates is expected, language regarding the exact pace of future changes will likely influence the outlook for the Euro. Further, a decision to pursue TLTROs could spark greater price action in broader markets including equities than that of mere tone and language regarding hikes. 
$$$$
Chart prepared by John Kicklighter 
$$$$
Although the ECB ended its previous round of QE in December 2018, some central bank officials have discussed implementing another infusion as European growth and inflation trend lower. If the bank does announce another round of TLTROs, it would equate to a materially dovish development from the central bank and would likely pressure the Euro as supply of the currency increases. In turn, such a decision could bring about an improvement in global risk appetite as markets weigh the consequences of monetary stimulus in the bloc which is effectively the world’s second largest economy.

On the other hand, a decision to wait for further TLTROs may pressure global risk appetite and spark a bullish reaction in the Euro. Either way, the eventualities will likely spill over into the US equity session and influence the Dow Jones and other indices.

While a relatively weaker US Dollar may provide a stronger case for US exports and corporate profits, the more immediate concern likely lies with the risk-on or risk-off sentiment following the central bank’s decision.

$$$$
Over the last six months, the DAX has recaptured some ground compared to the US Industrial Average as markets readjust the policy leanings of the respective central banks. Another round of LTRO from the ECB tomorrow could make meaningful inroads to bolster the DAX’s valuation compared to that of the Dow Jones.  
$$$$
At the same time, the Dow will look for a spark to drive through nearby resistance. The resistance has proved impenetrable since October’s equity rout and bullish action across the pond may provide the necessary catalyst for a drive higher.

EUR/USD to break through 1.1305 key support?

$$$$
The Euro may break below a key support at 1.1305 if commentary from the ECB signals greater pessimism over Eurozone growth. Officials are expected to keep rates on hold while the Continent wrestles with slower growth in key Eurozone economies and unprecedented political fragmentation. Significant moves in the Euro will not likely stem from the actual rate decision but from the comments that will follow.

EUR/USD- Daily Chart 
$$$$
The ECB is anticipated to cut its outlook to such a degree that it may warrant the renewal of Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) in effort to provide stimulus. Anticipation of slower growth and lower yields was a possible reason why Italian, French and German bond prices all edged higher. Bond prices and yields move inversely to each other. 
$$$$
Chart Showing German, Italian, French Bond Prices
$$$$
Eurozone GDP is scheduled to be released a few hours before the ECB announcement which may make Euro traders jittery. Preliminary forecasts show seasonally-adjusted year-on-year growth at 1.2 percent. With Italy in a technical recession and German growth showing stagnation, the possibility of overperforming GDP does not appear very likely. 
$$$$
Looking ahead, fears surrounding the uncertainty of Brexit and US-China trade relations may continue to weigh on risk appetite. Additional anxiety Euro traders may face is a possible eruption of an EU-US trade conflict. This concern re-emerged after President Trump received a report from the Commerce Department outlining potential threats posed by importing autos.

Asia Pacific benchmark stock indexes mostly traded lower, echoing on weakness from Wednesday’s Wall Street trading session. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was one of the worst performers, declining over 0.8%. China’s Shanghai Composite fell roughly 0.2% heading into the close despite more rhetoric from government officials to support the economy.
$$$$
China’s Finance Minister, Liu Kun, said that tax cuts are a top fiscal priority this year. Economic growth in the country has slowed to its weakest pace in a decade and estimate for GDP this year were lowered. Elsewhere, South Korea’s KOSPI aimed more than 0.4% to the downside while Australia’s ASX 200 continued climbing towards August highs.
$$$$
Looking at the major currencies, the pro-risk Australian and New Zealand Dollars ended up cautiously gaining. AUD/USD rose alongside a pickup in two-year government bond yields, signaling ebbing dovish RBA monetary policy expectations. Earlier in the day, Australia’s trade surplus unexpectedly rose to its highest since December 2016. This may positively contribute to growth down the road.
$$$$
Over the remainder of the day, all eyes will be on the ECB rate decision. It could be the next central bank, after the BoC yesterday, to disappoint hawkish monetary policy bets (as has been the case lately with the majors). Overnight index swaps are pricing in about a 30% chance of a hike by the end of the year. If this ends up being the case, EUR/USD may fall while equities, such as the Euro Stoxx 50, could find support.
$$$$
Euro Stoxx 50 futures paused the ascent from earlier this year that has led to gains of about 14.5%. Resistance stopped the index at 3337, former support from July 2018 that came into play later in August. A shooting star candle highlights indecision which often leads to a turning point. A break under the near-term rising support line from the beginning of February opens the door to testing the next one from January.

ECB Meeting Preview: EUR Price to Rise if There is no Mention of TLTROs	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/03/07/ECB-Meeting-Preview-EUR-Price-to-Rise-if-There-is-no-Mention-of-TLTROs.html	1551949200	"
The European Central Bank will leave all its key interest rates unchanged today, Thursday, and is unlikely to change its forward guidance.
$$$$
That means attention will center on likely downgrades to its economic growth and inflation forecasts by the ECB staff, and on whether it will signal a new round of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations.
$$$$
If it fails to do so, that could lead to a firmer Euro.
"	"
The European Central Bank will likely announce today, Thursday, that it is keeping all its key interest rates unchanged and will almost certainly make no change in its forward guidance that rates will be left where they are “at least through the summer of 2019”.
$$$$
That means traders should focus on likely lower economic growth and inflation forecasts and on whether the ECB statement at 1245 GMT, or the subsequent press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi at 1330 GMT, includes a reference to a new round of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations. If not, a rise in the Euro price could follow.
$$$$
TLTROs are a way of providing cheap funding to banks to encourage them to boost economic activity by lending more and you can read more about them here.
$$$$
Taking the ECB’s forecasts first, recent evidence suggests the Eurozone economy is weakening. The OECD inter-governmental think tank predicted Wednesday that GDP growth in the region would be just 1.0% in 2019, down from 1.8% in 2018 and below its previous projection of a same-again 1.8%. Its prediction for 2020 was lowered to 1.2% from 1.6%.
$$$$
OECD Cuts Global Economic Growth Forecasts Again
$$$$
Earlier this week, the composite purchasing managers’ index for the Eurozone in February suggested the region would struggle in the first quarter to beat the sickly 0.2% expansion seen in the fourth quarter of last year.
$$$$
Arguably, however, this economic weakness is already priced in to the Euro price so instead traders should focus on whether the ECB signals a new round of TLTROs. No launch is expected to be announced before April or even June, with the ECB likely to be in “wait and see” mode until then – especially as the central bank’s asset-purchase program only ended in December.
$$$$
Both are designed to loosen monetary policy, TLTROs doing so by injecting money into the financial system to boost growth and inflation. However, the markets are still expecting the ECB to signal that they are now on the agenda and a failure to do so would likely reverse the downtrend in EURUSD in place since the end of last month.
$$$$
Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)
$$$$
Either way, though, slower than previously expected GDP growth means the interest rate outlook is now bearish so a dovish shift by the ECB is likely eventually – making a downward move in the Euro a distinct possibility longer-term.

Consequently, the downgrades have allowed for the ECB to open the stimulus taps yet again. $$$$
EURUSD fell 30pips to session lows of 1.1273 after the ECB announced that they will be delivering fresh stimulus in the form of TLTRO 111, which will be starting from September 2019 and ending in March 2021.

Job reports out of the US and Canada scheduled for 13:30 GMT tomorrow should cap off this week’s market-moving data releases.

Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
EURUSD currently changes hands around 1.13850, the lowest level in 10-days as more weak economic data fuels fears over the health of the Euro-Zone economy. The latest German Factory Orders (y/y) contracted by 7% - although last month’s negative figure was revised higher – continuing a trend of under-par economic data releases from the single-block. German 2019 growth has already been downgraded to 1% from 1.8%, while recent PMI data showed Euro Zone growth nearing stagnation.
$$$$
Italian government continue to collect headlines with fears growing that the country’s debt pile will weigh further. A report in Reuters showed that EUR425 billion of the country’s EUR1.5 trillion of debtis held by French, German and Spanish banks. Any further bond sell-off/rise in yields could fuel fears of a further balance sheet pressure for an already weak European banking sector. Recent ECB talk suggests a new batch of cheap loans for European banks (TLTROs) have been discussed by the central bank recently in a fresh attempt to increase liquidity into the banking system.
$$$$
EURUSD is back below 1.1400 and has formed six daily ‘lower high’ candles in a row, highlighting the market’s bearish sentiment. The 1.1500 level has proved stubborn resistance for the pair recent ly due to a confluence of old swing lows and the 200-day moving average. EURUSD is also below its 20- and 50-day moving averages, while the RSI indicator is pointing lower. There are no real support levels all the way down to the 1.1300 area, a level that has proved difficult to fully break so far. 
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment data currently shows retail are 53.4% net-long EURUSD, a bearish contrarian indicator. In addition, traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger EURUSD bearish contrarian trading bias.

$$$$
The German economy expanded by 1.5% in 2018, sharply lower than the 2.2% increase recorded in 2017, according to preliminary data released by the Federal Statistics Office earlier today. The data suggests that German Q4 growth was positive after contracting by 0.2% in the third quarter, although this is likely to be marginal, while today’s annual number may be revised going forward. This lack of growth in the second-half of 2018 is likely to roll-over into 2019 and will weigh on the single currency, crimping the ECB’s ability to tighten monetary policy later in the year. The recent run of weak Euro-Zone data continues to undermine the Euro, and this may continue Wednesday and Thursday when Germany and the EU release their latest inflation figures.

DailyFX Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts for EURUSD 
$$$$
In light of the deterioration in the global growth outlook, President Draghi provided some more dovish signals in yesterday’s speech, consequently placing the Euro on the backfoot. President Draghi noted that recent economic developments have been weaker than expected. As a reminder, yesterday saw growth in Germany dropping to the lowest level in 5yrs, albeit narrowly avoiding a technical recession. Aside from the growth aspect, inflation pressures have eased amid the plunge in oil prices. As such, the ECB President highlighted a significant amount of monetary policy is still needed (alluding to forward guidance on interest rates and reinvestments). 
$$$$
Most notably, Draghi stated that there is no room for complacency, subsequently opening the door to a dovish statement at next week’s ECB meeting. Risks to the economic outlook is tilted to the downside, despite the ECB’s insistence that growth risks remain broadly balanced.

EURUSD Price Chart: Daily Time Frame (Aug 2018 – Jan 2019)
$$$$
EURUSD continues to remain with the broad 1.13-1.15 range with extremes being faded. For the time being this may continue, with little to suggest that there will be a firm range break in the near-term. Elsewhere, German bund yields are negative out to 9yrs, however, the spread has narrowed against US treasuries with the 2yr spread at -315bps from the low of -361bps.
$$$$
The Federal Reserve’s most notable hawk, Ester George, joined the doves of the Fed after making the case that the central bank can be patient when looking at making further adjustments to interest rates. Fed’s George added that a pause in the normalisation process would provide time to assess the economy. As such, this supports the general view of the Fed that they may pause until June.

In addition, the RSI indicator has just turned lower from a multi-month high, weighing on the pair.

ECB President Mario Draghi recently said that growth across the single-block remained weak, adding that ‘a significant amount of monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.'
$$$$
A look at the EURUSD daily chart confirms this negative backdrop for the single-currency, with three lower highs/lower lows printed. The pair have also just slipped below both the 20-and 50-day moving average – a negative sign – and trade at levels last seen on January 4. Support below starts at 1.1345 but there is little in the way of a re-test of 1.1300. Below here, the recent 19-month low at 1.1215 comes into play before 1.1187, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the January 2017 – February 2018 move.

French PMI suggest further economic woes ahead.

Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
The single-currency is coming under renewed downside pressure ahead from another set of negative data releases and may choose to re-test the stubborn 1.1300 level sooner rather than later. And today’s ECB policy meeting is unlikely to stem the downward move with central bank President Mario Draghi expected to outline that monetary policy will remain loose for as long as necessary. Financial markets have now pushed back the first 10bp rate hike into 2020, while QE reinvestments may last for longer than originally expected.
$$$$
The latest set of Markit PMIs show the French economy continuing to suffer with their Composite index pointing to the quickest contraction in French private sector output for over four years. The German PMI data broke its recent run of successive falls, but Manufacturing output fell to 50-month low, hit by weakness in the auto industry and a slowdown of demand from China.
$$$$
EURUSD remains unable to make a clean break through the 1.1300 area in 2019 despite the poor data seen over the past month. It may be that the ECB is defending this level in the face of adversity knowing that there may be worse news to come out of the EU. The technical set-up remains negative with the pair under all three moving averages, while the three-week low at 1.1335 is just a few pips away. The 1.1300 handle may prove difficult to break, but unless Mario Draghi pulls a rabbit out of his hat, the single-currency will break lower and make a fresh 19-month low under 1.1215 before moving towards the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.1187.

EURUSD Price Stable as ECB Leaves Rates Unchanged, Draghi Up Next	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/01/24/EURUSD-Price-Stable-as-ECB-Leaves-Rates-Unchanged-Draghi-Up-Next.html	1548334500	"
EURUSD was stable Thursday after the European Central Bank left all its benchmark interest rates unchanged, as expected.
$$$$
Now the market is focused on comments by ECB President Mario Draghi at his press conference scheduled for 1330 GMT.
"	"
The European Central Bank’s rate-setting Governing Council has left all its key interest rates unchanged: its refinancing rate at zero, its deposit rate at -0.40% and the rate on its marginal lending facility at 0.25%. The decision was as forecast and EURUSD was little changed in response.
$$$$
Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)

In a statement, the ECB said again that it expects rates to remain unchanged at least “through the summer” of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary. The Governing Council intends to keep reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under its asset-purchase program for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising rates.
$$$$
Now, the markets’ focus is on a press conference at 1330 GMT by ECB President Mario Draghi. Against the background of a slowing Eurozone economy, the most important question will be whether the ECB still expects to raise Eurozone interest rates in the third quarter of this year or whether an increase will likely be postponed to the fourth quarter or even to 2020.

Indeed, as growth slows, it is even possible that the next move will be further rate cuts.

EURUSD Price: Renewed Downward Pressure Hints at New Lows	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/01/25/EURUSD-Price-Renewed-Downward-Pressure-Hints-at-New-Lows.html	1548404640	"
The German economy will grow by just 1% in 2019.
$$$$
 The EURUSD 1.1300 level continues to hold but for how long?
"	"
Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
The constant flow of bad economic news in the Euro-Zone has yet to fully impact the single-currency which currently trades around 1.1320.  Respected German newspaper Handelsblatt ran a sourced report late Thursday which said that the German government had downgraded growth to just 1% in 2019, down from a prior 1.8% projection just a few months ago. This figure coincides with a report out just over a week ago from the German business body BDI which said that a disorderly Brexit would hammer German growth.
$$$$
Sentiment reports out this week have also highlighted the current weakness in the Euro-Zone and more may be to follow today when German IFO data is released. Expectations are for further falls and more negative news for the Euro-Zone’s economic engine. The ECB professional forecasters also release their latest views on Friday morning.
$$$$
EURUSD Price Likely to Face Renewed ECB Headwinds.
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment currently gives us a mixed trading bias despite retail data showing traders long EURUSD by a ratio of 1.84 to 1 (64.7%). Retail traders have remained net-long of EURUSD since January 10 when the pair traded near 1.1508.
$$$$
EURUSD continues to press the 1.1300 level without a decisive move lower. Any time the pair break below here they rebound, although these bounce-backs are looking weaker. A clean break below 1.1300 opens the way to the 1.1210-1.1220 area seen back in November before the important 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the January 2017 – February 2018 move comes into play at 1.1186. If things turn very bearish for the pair, the January low around 1.0340 would retrace the whole rally.

EURUSD Hitting Resistance After Dovish Fed Boost	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/01/31/EURUSD-Hitting-Resistance-After-Dovish-Fed-Boost.html	1548925200	"
US dollar outlook changing as further interest rate hikes are priced out of the market.
$$$$
 200-day moving average may slow the move higher in the short-term.
"	"
Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
Fed Chair Jerome Powell sent USD-bulls running for cover late Wednesday, arguing that the case for further US interest rate hikes had ‘weakened somewhat’ after he downgraded US economic activity to ‘solid’ from ‘strong’. Jerome Powell also revised his guidance on the balance sheet normalization plan, hinting that the balance sheet is now close to its optimum size, another mildly-dovish twist. Markets have now fully priced-out any further US interest rate hikes in 2019 and are now hinting at potential rate cuts in 2020, a complete U-turn from market pricing seen in mid-to-late 2018.
$$$$
The technical outlook for the Euro is looking slightly more positive but further progress is being stalled by the 200-day moving average, currently sitting on top of EURUSD at 1.1518. This also coincides with a previous horizontal support level from mid-2018. The 1.1500 level has held as resistance recently – apart from a brief break at the start of the year– and a break and close above the January high at 1.1572 would open the way for further upside. The RSI indicator shows the pair moving towards overbought territory and is closing in on its highest level since September 2018. The upside move may be blown off-course on Friday with release of the latest US Labour Report at 13.30 GMT. Another strong NFP reading – December saw 312k new jobs created – could stiffen the dollar’s resolve and bring the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.1448 back into play.

Eurozone GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 was unchanged from Q3’s 0.2% increase quarter/quarter, staying at its lowest rate in four years.

Italian GDP data showed the country is now in a technical recession.

The Euro eased slightly on the figures but continues to be driven principally by events in the US and by the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU.

Economic growth in the Eurozone was just 0.2% quarter/quarter in the fourth quarter of last year according to preliminary “flash” data. That was the same growth rate as in the third quarter and was in line with expectations, showing growth stuck at its lowest rate in four years.
$$$$
Meanwhile in Italy GDP contracted by 0.2% quarter/quarter in Q4 after a 0.1% fall in Q3, putting Italy into a technical recession.
$$$$
In response, EURUSD slipped back, as did the Euro against the British Pound, Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc.

Looking ahead though, the Euro will likely be driven principally by events in the US.

As for EURGBP, that will likely be driven largely by the Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK.

Italy’s contracting economy could re-open the budget crisis with the EU
"	"
EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
For more in-depth analysis on EUR, read the brand new Q1 2019 FX forecast guides
$$$$
The Italian economy contracts for a second quarter in a row which means it has entered a technical recession, stalling the recent EUR/USD rally. The monthly figure was hinted by Italian president Giuseppe Conte yesterday, a day before the official release, as he mentioned that the Italian economy had probably shrunk in the fourth quarter. The quarterly rate, a fall of 0.2% (Exp. -0.1%) is not a big surprise, following Italy’s budget crisis with the EU in October and the notion that growth is slowing in many economies around the world. Continuing weaker-than-expected economic data being released by Germany, coupled with France’s private sector slowdown in the month of December, hinted that the Eurozone was likely to experience a slowdown in growth in the last quarter of 2018, which is confirmed by the Eurozone GDP figure announced today, a growth of just 0.2% (Exp. 0.2%). After the announcement, EUR/USD was trading marginally lower halting its recent rally and hovering just below the 1.15 handle. 
$$$$
One of the likely implications of Italy’s contracting economy is that it could re-open the budget dispute between Italy and the EU, whereby the latter may demand Italy to lower its already revised deficit budget of 2.04 per cent of GDP (down from 2.4) which may in turn lead to further increases in the spread between the Italian 10-year bond yield and the German Bund, which act as a benchmark for sovereign risk in the Eurozone.

Yellow Vest protests may be disrupting economic activity

Deeper EU-wide economic slowdown on the horizon?
"	"

$$$$
EUR/USD may dip after France’s CPI data is released on January 29 at 07:45 GMT. Forecasts currently stand at 88 with the previous report showing 87. Broadly speaking, economic data coming out of France has been lackluster and frequently falling short of expectations. The Yellow Vest (gilet jaunes) protests have played a crucial role in France’s economic performance, particularly consumer confidence. 
$$$$
The protests emerged in the last breaths of 2018. The protesters were motivated primarily by rising fuel prices, the high cost of living and grievances against certain tax codes. The protests turned into riots and eventually devolved into clashes with police and the destruction of property. 
$$$$
The participants involved gave a list of demands, some of which required the repealing of the fuel tax, raising the minimum wage and the resignation of President Emmanuel Macron. As a result of the domestic tribulations, his ratings have plummeted. Meanwhile, nationalist politician Marie La Pen’s popularity has grown, putting France in danger of having a Eurosceptic representation in the European Parliament in 2019. 
$$$$
The disturbance from the protests have only worsened, with a counter-movement known as the “Red Scarves” (foulards rouges) having marched against the initial protestors this past Sunday. This kind of political fissuring and discontent is part of a broader European trend in political fragmentation that may be made more apparent this year in the European Parliamentary (EP) elections in May. 
$$$$
The protests have resulted in trade losses because of blocked routes necessary for transportation along with slower consumption. Other notable indicators that have taken a hit have been the Composite and Services PMI data, coming in at 47.9 and 47.5, undershooting the forecasts of 51 and 50.5, respectively. 
$$$$
The Yellow Vests are now beginning to organize themselves into a political unit and are aiming to participate in the EP elections. They are currently forecasted to win 13 percent of the vote. Macron may also anger Eurosceptics around the continent because his revised budget deficit – as a way to accommodate the protestors demand – may breach the 3 percent threshold. This would put Brussels in a tighter spot with Italy. 
$$$$
As the third largest Eurozone economy – following the UK and Germany – what happens in France politically and economically can bear tremendous implications for the Euro. Growth in Germany is already slowing, Italy is teetering on a recession, and the UK is in the midst of a tangled Brexit arrangement.
$$$$
The Euro, after breaking above a key resistance, appears now to be bouncing off 1.1435, and could potentially head down to 1.1415. If French Consumer Confidence comes in lower than expected, it could cause EUR/USD to break below the latter price level. 
$$$$
EUR/USD – Daily Chart 
$$$$
Later this week, a cascade of European economic data will be released primarily on January 31 and February 1. The release of these indicators – particularly Italy’s GDP – will almost certainly impact the Euro. The IMF, ECB and World Bank all have made forecasts of slower growth in Europe. This data will therefore be a key event to monitor because the results could validate the outlooks and exert pressure on the Euro.

Euro Vulnerable to EU Data Dump? Markets Eyeing Italian GDP	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/01/31/Euro-Vulnerable-to-EU-Data-Dump-Markets-Eyeing-Italian-GDP.html	1548903600	"
How vulnerable is to the Euro to the upcoming data dump?
$$$$
Forecasts indicate slower growth – magnitude could vary 
$$$$
Why is Italian GDP important, how will it impact the Euro?
"	"
See our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy!
$$$$
The Euro may be closely watched this week as a cascade of data out of the EU is scheduled to be released on January 31. Markets will be eyeing data coming out of Italy in particular, given the state of its economy and the recently semi-resolved budget dispute. All of this would be occurring against the backdrop of forecasted slower growth – with data in recent months confirming it. 
$$$$
Doubt in the underlying strength of the Italian economy can be most obviously seen in the spread between Italian and German ten-year bond yields. Its sharp widening since May indicates that investors have greater trepidation in lending to Rome over Berlin. The gap’s growth accelarated during the months of debate over Italy’s controversial budget proposal. 
$$$$
Spread on Italian-German 10-Year Bond Yields
$$$$
Tomorrow, this spread may expand further if Italian GDP comes in at or below the current forecast. In the third quarter, GDP shrunk to -0.1%. If the country reports another consecutive contraction, it will have entered a technical recession. 
$$$$
The danger behind this – besides the obvious complications a recession poses – is it may re-ignite the budget dispute between Rome and Brussels. Officials may demand that the Italian government revise their already watered-down budget of 2.04 percent (down from 2.4) even lower if the country is undergoes a recession. 
$$$$
Deputy Prime Ministers Luigi Di Maoi of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini of the Lega Norda will likely push back against any further reforms. The populist government’s campaign was built on an anti-establishment platform. If they were to capitulate to Brussels, it could potentially undermine their political clout and endanger their performance in the 2019 European Parliamentary elections. 
$$$$
Other key indicators of economic health – such as PMI Manufacturing – will likely be under observation. If Italy, the third largest economy in the Eurozone, enters a recession and indicators reveal underlying economic momentum is lagging, the Euro may fall over fears of a possible Eurozone crisis. 
$$$$
Key economic indicators coming out of France for the past few months have been lackluster at best with many barometers – such as consumer confidence and manufacturing – falling short of expectations. While Consumer Confidence and quarter-on-quarter GDP did outperform relative to forecasts, the broad trend remains on the downside. 
$$$$
Some of the impact on these indicators are politically rooted. The recent eruption in France with the Yellow Vest protestors have weighed on economic performance. This week, the second largest economy in the Eurozone will have its CPI and Manufacturing PMI data released on January 31 and February 1, respectively. 
$$$$
This comes after the year-on-year Producer Price Index performed worse than the previous report, and consumer spending fell short of forecasts by a substantial margin. Looking ahead, monitoring developments relating to the Yellow Vest protests will be crucial in order to understand the impact it has on the French economy and the possible effect on the Euro.  
$$$$
The German economy narrowly avoided a recession this year when quarter-on-quarter GDP reported a positive number after the -0.2 percent contraction in Q3. If the largest economy in Germany undergoes a recession, this would not likely bode well for the Euro, considering the precarious state of the other major Eurozone economies. 
$$$$
This also comes during a time when the popularity of Europhile liberals – such as French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel – are declining while Eurosceptic populism is on the rise. The economic implications of an ideological re-alignment during an economic slowdown will not likely bode well for the Euro’s long-term outlook. 
$$$$
On the data front, Germany’s retail sales, unemployment reports and Manufacturing PMI is scheduled to be released on January 31 and February 1, respectively. Similar to France and Italy – and most of Europe for that matter – economic data even in the German economy has been unimpressive and – now more frequently – underwhelming. 
$$$$
The combination of slower growth and acceleration of liberal-alternative ideologies has the potential to create a negative feedback loop. Studies have indicated that when economic conditions worsen, the propensity for voters to swing to radical ends of the political spectrum increases. The election of Eurosceptic officials with anti-establishment economic agendas could then threaten the integrity of the EU and weigh on the Euro.  
$$$$
In the long-run outlook, the Euro will likely fall given the potential political economy headwinds the currency faces in 2019. In the shorter term, EUR/USD appears to have broken through the January resistance and more recently shot up through the 1.1435 price barrier and closed above it at 1.1478. 
$$$$
EUR/USD – Daily Chart 
$$$$
While for Euro bulls this may be encouraging, it is important to not forget the long-term outlook. Since April, EUR/USD has declined over 10 percent. Given the outlook for 2019, it is likely the Euro will continue to fall, barring any unexpected developments that could push the Euro on a long-term upward trajectory.

EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
DailyFX Q1 2019 Trading Forecasts for EURUSD 
$$$$
Despite the slightly better than expected Eurozone services and composite PMI figures, the Euro remains in limbo, with the subdued readings unlikely to ease fears over a slowdown within the Eurozone. IHS Markit noted that the PMI indicates that GDP is growing at quarterly rate of 0.1%, which mark the worst reading since 2013. Consequently, with upside risks somewhat limited, there is little signs to suggest that the EURUSD range that has been intact for the past 4-months is set to break in the near term. Elsewhere, 1.1bln worth of vanilla option expiries at 1.1400-10 (noted here) may attract in quiet conditions.
$$$$
Both 1-week and 1-month implied volatility has dropped to the lowest level in over a year. While risk reversals have moved closer to neutral with recent sessions seeing premium for puts (downside protection) paired. Subsequently, suggesting that EURUSD may continue to be somewhat directionless in the short term with the 1.12-1.16 range to remain intact.
$$$$
Given the indications that Eurozone GDP is growing at its weakest rate since the Eurozone debt crisis, this will likely affirm the ECB’s cautious stance, with growth forecasts being cut at the March meeting. Alongside this, the ECB may be forced to provide fresh dovish signals, potentially in the form of new TLTROs. As it stands, markets are currently pricing in a 46% likelihood that the ECB could raise the depo rate. However, given the continued uncertainty regarding the global outlook, risks are for a rate hike to be pushed out to Q1 2020.
$$$$
While EURUSD remains in limbo, downside support is seen at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement (1.1357), a break below opens up for a test of key support at the 1.1300 figure. Euro bulls on the other hand would need to see a closing break above 1.1570 (Jan 10th high) to allow for a move towards 1.1650.

EUR/USD Eyeing Germany Factory Orders as EU Slows, Risks Rise	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/02/06/EURUSD-Eyeing-Germany-Factory-Orders-as-EU-Slows-Risks-Rise-----.html	1549416600	"
Euro may dip on German Factory Orders

"	"
See our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy!
$$$$
EUR/USD may fall as Germany prepares to unveil its month-on-month Factory Orders data. Forecasts are at 0.3% percent with the previous at -1.0 percent. The French economy has sputtered recently while Italy has fallen into a technical recession, with the largest economy in the Eurozone only narrowly avoiding the latter’s fate. The impact of trade wars on China’s economy has had a negative knock-on effect on Germany’s growth even as fragmenting European politics generate their own uncertainty. 
$$$$
The largest economy in the Eurozone only narrowly missed a recession recently as France sputters and Italy fell into a recession. The impact of the trade wars on China’s economy also impacted Germany’s growth as fissuring European politics e.g. Brexit produce uncertainty. 
$$$$
The ECB recognizes the severity of the situation and potential obstacles the EU faces in 2019. Addressing the European Parliament last month, ECB President Mario Draghi stated that “…over the past few months, incoming information has continued to be weaker than expected…the persistence of uncertainties, in particular, relating to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment”. 
$$$$
Overall growth is expected to slow, leaving Germany – on which many countries depend for growth – vulnerable to a recession. This opens the door for a potentially catastrophic Eurozone crisis as the EU prepares to have the European Parliamentary elections in spring. Under these circumstances, German data may be more closely monitored than before as traders attempt to gauge the outlook for Europe.
$$$$
In the more immediate future, EUR/USD is trading slightly lower after re-testing 1.1478 and may reach closer to 1.1358 if the data disappoints. Conversely if the report comes in better than expected the pair might aim for 1.1435. For the time being EUR/USD is floating around 1.1406, possibly waiting for the outcome of the upcoming data and any major developments from the US President’s State of the Union address.

See our free guide to learn how touse economic news in your trading strategy!
$$$$The Euro may dip on Monday after Italian inflation data is released, potentially dampening bullish sentiment as investors eye the recession in Italy and the risk it may pose to the Eurozone. Inflation forecasts for month-on-month and year-on-year EU Harmonized CPI stand at -1.9 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. $$$$Given the slower economic growth in Italy, it is more likely these numbers will undershoot forecasts. However, the potential magnitude of each indicator will vary and could amplify the amplitude of the Euro’s movement, especially given the current economic circumstances. $$$$
Forecasts from the IMF and World Bank indicate that the European economy will be slowing down 2019. It is therefore not outlandish to suggest that the Euro may have trouble recovering from its decline in 2018 amid the gloomier outlook and potential risk of another Eurozone crisis. This comes against the backdrop of the Brexit stalemate with longer-term fears over the European parliamentary elections in May. $$$$The Euro may close closer to 1.1435 if the data falls short. This comes after EUR/USD reached 1.1478 and subsequently retreated after underlying momentum failed to carry the pair above the resistance. The Euro may trade between 1.1478-1.1435 as investors attempt to gauge the potential risks of an Italian recession and peril from a no-deal Brexit.  $$$$

See our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy!
$$$$The Euro may move on Germany’s month-on-month Industrial Production data after Factory Orders numbers came in at -1.6 percent, substantially undershooting the 0.3 percent forecast. For over a year now, industrial production data has been on a downtrend since last year but has recently accelerated as the European economy slows down. The current forecast for tomorrow’s report is 0.8 percent growth with the previous at -1.9 percent.  $$$$This comes as the three largest Eurozone economies are slowing down with Italy now in a technical recession, opening the door for another potential Eurozone crisis. With Germany slowing down as the region struggles with sluggish growth and political fragmentation, risk is beginning to grip the market. The spread between Italian and German bond yields has widened after a brief respite.$$$$
Spread Between Italian and German 10-Year Bond Yields 
$$$$ In this environment, investors are not looking for a compelling rate of return but instead are focused on preserving capital. This trend might accelerate as European headwinds – such as Brexit and the European Parliamentary elections – begin to blow. This may be compounded by the uncertainty over the US-China trade war and concern that the ECB might start tightening at a time when looser credit conditions are required. $$$$The Euro may dip if the data undershoots. The potential magnitude will vary and could amplify the amplitude of the Euro’s movement, especially given the current economic conditions. EUR/USD appears to be struggling to aim higher after hitting 1.1358. The next possible price barrier the pair will have to overcome stands at 1.1415. Given the fundamental outlook, it is difficult to say with confidence the Euro has much room to grow.$$$$

The current strength in the US dollar is hitting EURUSD hard and pushing it lower with seven daily lower highs currently registering on the chart.And further falls may be ahead when the European Commission publish their latest economic forecasts.
$$$$
The US dollar continues to push higher and is within sight of a fresh one-month high on little real economic news or data. Treasury yields remain supportive against other major currencies, while the Fed perhaps remains as the only major central bank expected to hike this year. The US dollar basket chart remains positive – above all three moving averages – and a break and close above the January 24 high at 96.15 is seemingly likely. The RSI indicator is currently trading near a two-month high, suggesting the move may be becoming overbought.  
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment data currently shows retail are 56.0% net-long EURUSD, a bearish contrarian indicator. In addition, traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger EURUSD bearish contrarian trading bias.
$$$$
The latest in a long-line of weak EU data releases saw German industrial production fall further, missing already low expectations. Today’s release follows Wednesday’s German factory order numbers which fell sharply to -7% y/y, highlighting the growth problems in Euro-Zone. Later today the European Commission will release its latest Economic Forecasts and growth expectations will be cut from the Autumn release. The last report saw growth expectations in the Euro-Zone cut to 1.9% for 2019 and 1.7% for 2020, numbers that now look unlikely to be reached.
$$$$
EURUSD retains a negative bias as it falls back towards the 1.1300 level. This level continues to provide an area of support, but if broken then the November low of 1.1215 comes quickly into play, ahead of 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at 1.1187.

European Commission Cuts Eurozone Growth Forecasts, EUR Sliding	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2019/02/07/European-Commission-Cuts-Eurozone-Growth-Forecasts-EUR-Sliding.html	1549535400	"
The European Commission has cut its forecast for Eurozone GDP growth this year to 1.3% from 1.9% and for next year to 1.6% from 1.7%.
$$$$
It has also slashed its prediction for GDP growth in Italy this year to just 0.2% from the 1.2% previously predicted.
$$$$
Its latest quarterly economic forecasts will likely ensure that the current downward pressure on the Euro persists. 
"	"
The European Commission has cut its forecasts for Eurozone GDP growth in 2019 and 2020, citing global trade tensions and a slowdown in the Chinese economy. It has also reduced its estimates of inflation, predicting a decline to 1.4% in 2019 from 1.7% in 2018.
$$$$
That makes a tightening of monetary policy this year by the European Central Bank even less likely than previously, and that will likely ensure that the recent weakness of the Euro continues near-term.
$$$$
Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)
$$$$
The Commission is particularly concerned about Italy, cutting its economic growth forecast for 2019 to 0.2% from its previous estimate of 1.2%. It blamed uncertainty over government policies and higher borrowing costs for pushing Italy into recession in the second half of last year.
$$$$
Earlier Thursday, the European Central Bank also warned in its latest Economic Bulletin of slower Eurozone growth momentum ahead. The ECB said incoming data have “continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and some country and sector-specific factors. In particular, the persistence of uncertainties relating to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment.”
$$$$
It added: “Overall, the risks surrounding the Euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility.”
$$$$
There was more gloom from Germany too, with news that German industrial output fell in December for the fourth successive month. It dropped by 0.4% month/month – better than the previous month’s revised fall of 1.3% but confounding expectations of a 0.8% increase.
$$$$
Separately, the country’s DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce cut its 2019 growth forecast for Germany to 0.9% from 1.7%, pointing to growing headwinds from abroad for Europe’s biggest economy.

$$$$
However, fundamental analysis suggests the move could be a false break higher – a bull trap for optimistic traders.
$$$$
Recent data show clear signs that the Eurozone economy is now faltering. Figures released Monday showed German factory orders down by a hefty 4.3% year/year in November and were followed Tuesday by news that German industrial production was down by an even larger 4.7% year/year that month.
$$$$
Eurozone confidence data for December, released the same day, also missed forecasts and German trade numbers for November, published Wednesday, showed a steep 1.6% drop in German imports month/month.
$$$$
This all suggests that the European Central Bank may have to keep Eurozone interest rates low for even longer than previously expected – and that could damage the Euro in the days and weeks ahead.

Downside Risks to Growth and Inflation to Postpone ECB Rate Hike
"	"
EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
For more in-depth analysis on EUR, read the brand new Q1 2019 FX forecast guides
$$$$
German data continues to deteriorate with the latest industrial production figures falling sharply. The monthly rate surprised to the downside with a fall of 1.9% (Exp. 0.3%), which in turn dragged the yearly rate to -4.7% (Exp. -0.8%). This also follows yesterday’s weak factory order, consequently increasing the risk that Germany is heading for a technical recession. As such, EURUSD is softer this morning in reaction to yet another soft reading out of Germany, while resistance at 1.15 also proved to be a stumbling block for the pair. This in turn increases scope for another test of key support at 1.13. As a reminder, German GDP contracted by 0.2% in Q3, which was the worst performance in 5yrs. Next reading is scheduled for February 14th. 
$$$$
Not only is it growth that is heading lower but also inflation risks in the Eurozone are increasingly skewed to the downside, with the latter being weighed by the fall seen in oil prices. Last week saw headline Eurozone inflation drop to 1.6%, while the core reading remained subdued at 1%. Subsequently, this suggests that a deposit rate hike by the ECB this year looks somewhat doubtful. Money markets currently attach 45% chance of a 10bps rate hike by the year end.

EURUSD shrugged of the latest data, aided in part by a weaker US dollar, but doubts persist that the latest uptick is sustainable based on Eurozone data alone.

The announcement is a significant step forward in the US-China trade war
$$$$
Dow, S&P 500 dipped into the red as the news may have been leaked earlier Tuesday morning
$$$$
The agreement could contribute to a shift in sentiment on US-China trade talks which were thought to be deadlocked 
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
A substantial step forward in the US-China trade war was cemented Tuesday morning after China’s Vice Premier Liu He announced a reduction in tariffs on US autos from 40 percent to 15 percent. The change will make American cars considerably more affordable in the world’s largest market but perhaps more importantly, signifies the two nations are willing to negotiate after being locked in a bitter economic stalemate for months. The progress comes amid concerns from many analysts that the arrest of Huawei’s CFO would derail any good will built between the parties and stall talks.
$$$$
Despite the arrest, negotiations are set to continue between top officials in the coming days. Reports that China will once again purchase US agricultural products, most notably soybeans, have circulated but an official announcement has not yet been made. While Tuesday’s agreement was conducted over the phone Mr. Liu has announced he will travel to Washington “after the new year” to conduct talks in person. These discussions will likely take place within the 90-day trade truce that expires on March 1st. 
$$$$

$$$$
Tuesday’s progress could also spark a shift in sentiment regarding future trade war discussions. Markets may once again view discussion as an upside risk, a factor largely absent in recent weeks after the trade-truce was deemed underwhelming by many and geopolitical risks spurred a risk-off attitude. With that in mind, equity markets still managed to retrace most of their early morning gains. 
$$$$
Dow Jones Price Chart 15-Minute, December 11th (Chart 1)
$$$$
After a robust rally in early hours, the Dow and S&P 500 slowly forfeited their gains to trade near even for the day. Despite the mid-day trade war announcement, reports of the deal circulated earlier in the session which likely contributed to the gap higher and non-reaction when officially announced.
$$$$
General Motors Price Chart 15-Minute, December 11th (Chart 2)
$$$$
Unsurprisingly, shares of US automakers Ford, General Motors and Chrysler also gapped higher at the open but managed to hold onto most of their gains even as the trading session progressed. 
$$$$
Markets will now look to the verdict on Chinese purchases of US agricultural products to drive trade-war progress and sentiment. While those discussions may still be a work in progress, Tuesday’s announcement is a victory for US automakers and broader equity sentiment.

Above here, 1.1473 and the November 7 high at 1.1500 come into play. The pair have also made five higher lows in a row and trade back above both the 20- and 50-day moving average.
$$$$
A report over the weekend suggested that the EU may give Italy an additional six months to comply with its budget recommendations, a sign, if true, that the current frosty relationship between the two may be beginning to thaw. The ECB rejected Italy’s deficit target of 2.4% and wants it cut down to below 2.0%. Ahead, the last ECB meeting of the year, where the Italian budget will be one area under discussion. ECB President Mario Draghi may also warn that inflation pressures in the single-bloc are weakening while growth remains elusive, and the central bank may trim their growth and inflation forecasts.

The US dollar basket (DXY) starts the week on the back foot and has broken the uptrend that has been in place since late-September, and it is now trading below the 20- and 50-day moving average and nears a three-week low.

EURUSD May Weaken as ZEW Data Highlights Economic Weakness	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/12/11/EURUSD-May-Weaken-as-ZEW-Data-Highlights-Economic-Weakness.html	1544523600	"
German and Euro-Zone economic situation weakens – all eyes on the ECB.
$$$$
Italian Budget discussions continue.

Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
German ZEW data painted a mixed to negative picture Tuesday with a big miss in the current situation reading being marginally counterbalanced by the expectations and economic sentiment readings. The current situation reading slumped to 45.3 from a prior 58.2 (forecast 55.0), the expectations survey for December edged higher to -17.5 from -24.1 (forecast -25.0), while the economic sentiment survey nudged higher to -21 from -22 in November. 
$$$$
According to ZEW President Wambach, ‘The assessment of the economic situation has worsened dramatically for both Germany and the Eurozone. This is indicative of relatively weak economic growth in the fourth quarter. In addition, uncertainties also remain in terms of the looming international trade dispute and Brexit, which have a particularly negative impact on private investment and Germany’s exports.’ ECB President Mario Draghi’s rates decision and press conference on Thursday will be parsed closely for any signs that the central bank recognise this weakness.
$$$$
Italy and the European Union remain on a collision course over the contentious Budget proposal from Rome with the EU continuing its demands that Italy reduce its deficit target from 2.4% to avoid economic sanctions. According to Italian press reports, Italy has said that it may be able to reduce its deficit by around EUR4 billion, around half the amount that the EU is calling for, although Italy may point out to the EU that France is now increasing its budget deficit and that Rome should be given further slack. President Macron’s concessions, after a month of violent protests, could add around EUR8-10 billion to the country’s budget deficit according to different estimates. There are also reports circulating that suggest that the EU will give Italy an additional six months leeway to help them push towards target.

$$$$
US 3Q GDP and Eurozone Consumer Confidence readings out later.
"	"
This week’s 2 cent rally in EURUSD is now fading as traders square up their books ahead of the Christmas break. The move has been fueled by a weak US dollar on fears that a recession may be looming in late 2019-early 2020. US Treasury yields have fallen lower, weakening the greenback, while the sharp sell-off in the US equity markets has seen money pulled out of the previously risk-adverse US dollar and put to work in other haven currencies and assets. The Euro has not been immune from bad news with recent hard data prints from both Germany and the single-bloc missing expectations and pointing to weak growth prospects ahead, just as the ECB bond buying program finishes.

Later today the latest US Q3 GDP reading is expected to show the American economy is still in rude health, while later the December Euro-Zone consumer reading is expected to fall further into negative territory putting further downside pressure on EURUSD.

$$$$
The EURUSD 1.1300 – 1.1500 trading range in place since mid-October remains in place and should hold over the coming days as turnover fades lower.

EUR/USD rallies on Italian budget détente but prices may turn lower

Diverging monetary policy between Fed and ECB could point to losses
$$$$
Long-term market themes and upcoming inflation data in focus
"	"
The Euro has recently gained against the greenback, paring losses sustained for most of this year. However, whether EUR/USD extends its upside momentum or succumbs to long-term interest rate differentials is yet to be seen. Here’s what some of the DailyFX analysts think:
$$$$
EUR/USD’s failed attempt to test the November-high of 1.1500 and recent hawkish forward guidance from the Federal Reserve could indicate near-term bearish momentum, according to Currency Analyst David Song. Lingering interest rate differentials fuelled by the European Central Bank’s commitment to its zero interest rate policy, combined with long-term bearish formations in the Relative Strength Index, could also point towards losses for the currency pair. Near-term support for the Euro comes in near 1.1220 (78.6% retracement), while 1.1510 (38.2% expansion) could keep the unit capped into 2019.
$$$$
EUR/USD Chart (Daily)
$$$$
On the other hand, the currency pair could be poised for a rally on key fundamental themes, according to Currency Strategist James Stanley. A breakthrough in the Italian budget saga and the ECB’s recent announcement that bond buying in its quantitative easing program would end could spur a rally for EUR/USD. Euro bulls should look for a break above the 1.1500 level following fresh December highs, with further evidence of higher-low support. 
$$$$
EUR/USD Chart (8-hour)
$$$$
Looking ahead, low liquidity due to the holiday season and partial US government shutdown means that EUR/USD could be susceptible to volatile fundamental themes. Traders should keep a close eye on developments on long-term market issues, especially ongoing US-China trade talks, equities’ rout, and Brexit negotiations with the EU. In addition, the currency pair also faces the release of December’s US consumer confidence data and preliminary German inflation figures.

FOMC to hike interest rates by another 0.25% as economy rumbles on.
"	"
We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
The FOMC rate decision on Wednesday is the week’s major price point but releases out of Europe could have a bigger effect on EURUSD. Last week’s German ZEW reading’s disappointed while German and Europe PMI data missed across the board. This week we have German IFO data on Wednesday with expectations pointing to downside misses while on Friday, German and Euro-Zone consumer confidence will revealed, and again misses to the downside are expected.
$$$$
While the economic backdrop in Europe continues to weaken, the FOMC on Wednesday will hike US interest rates by 0.25% for a fourth time this year, underpinning the strength in the US dollar. The US dollar basket trades just below its recent 18-month high and continues to respect the uptrend started in late-September. 
$$$$
EURUSD remains just above 1.1300 but looks weak technically. The pair trade below all three moving averages and a break of the 1.1268 level leaves the recent 18-month low at 1.1216 vulnerable. The chart from late-September continues to show lower highs and a break to the downside is looking more likely.

EUR/USD in danger if commission decides to implement disciplinary procedure
"	"
The Euro may fall after the EU Commission meeting on December 19th where European leaders will possibly discuss implementing the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) against Italy. The EDP has never been used before on a member state and may entail economic fines between 0.2-0.5 percent of GDP.
$$$$
This comes shortly after news broke on Monday that a budget agreement between Brussels and Rome had not been reached. This follows last week’s European Council meeting that came after months of negotiations between Italy and the EU over the controversial budget. 
$$$$
Since May, the spread between Italian and German 10-year bonds has widened by over 120%, signaling greater skepticism of lending to Rome over Berlin. Since April, EUR/USD along with EUR/CHF has been falling as the region faces increased political fragmentation, slower growth and more uncertainty. The Euro, as a result, has suffered and will likely continue to fall into Q1 2019. 
$$$$
EUR/USD, EUR/CHF, Spread Between Italian and German 10-Year Bond Yields
$$$$
Brussels is caught between a rock and a hard place. If they are too harsh and punish Italy to such a degree that it plunges the country – which already has a slowing economy – into a recession, it then ratifies all the government’s claims that Brussels is a sovereignty-violating leviathan. This would in turn strengthen eurosceptics throughout the bloc and lead to greater fragmentation.
$$$$
If, however, the EU is too lenient, it will be read as a sign of weakness by anti-establishment groups which will likely take advantage of the situation and seek to implement their own agenda. Either outcome will not bode well for the Euro or European equities. The anti-risk Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc, however, may outperform in the risk-averse environment.

The short-term EURUSD set-up suggests higher prices ahead with the break above the 20- and 50-day moving averages at the end of last aiding the move higher. The pair now target the 1.1508 level, the November 6 high print, before the 200-day moving average at 1.1555 comes into play. Above here, the October 16 high at 1.1622 is the next target. A break below 1.1420 would open the way back to the 20- and 50-day moving averages between 1.1370 and 1.1390.
$$$$
The US dollar remains weak as 2019 starts as investors continue to price-in lower US interest rate expectations with the market now implying no rate hikes in 2019. In addition, the partial US government shutdown continues to weigh on the greenback as President Trump continues to look for funding for the Mexican border wall. The USD is nearing the 200-day moving average at 94.91 which should provide strong short-term support, although a break and close lower would leave the September 2018 lows around 93.30 as the next level of support.

Risks tilted to the Downside for Eurozone Inflation

Core inflation expected to remain at 1%
"	"
Euro Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
For a more in-depth analysis on EUR, check out the Q1 Forecast for EUR
$$$$
Ahead of today’s Eurozone inflation figures, risks are tilted to the downside with the headline reading expected to fall further away from the ECB’s inflation target amid the drop-in oil prices. Analysts see the headline rate dipping 0.1ppt to 1.8%. However, given the most recent German inflation figures which dropped to 1.7% from 2.3% and French CPI missing expectations at 1.9% (Exp. 2%), there is scope for a 1.7% reading. This is turn may not bode well for EURUSD. 
$$$$
While headline inflation is expected to dip, core inflation is seen remaining at 1%, which is typically what the ECB play close attention to. Consequently, EURUSD may see somewhat of a muted reaction, particularly given that external events, such as the deteriorating US data (Yesterday’s ISM) has been dictating the price action for the Euro. Eyes on US Labour report and comments from Powell.
$$$$

$$$$
Thus far EURUSD has struggled to maintain a firm foothold above 1.14, while strong support at 1.13 has keep the pair afloat. Price action in EURUSD has largely been supported by the weakening data in the US. However, trendline resistance from the September 2018 peak has held so far. A break above however, raises the scope for 1.1550.

The EURUSD price chart is looking positive after Wednesday’s climb above the 200-day moving average, with 1.16 the next level in sight.
$$$$
From a fundamental perspective, USD has been weakened by FOMC minutes suggesting that the Fed will think carefully before raising US interest rates again.
"	"
EURUSD broke above the 200-day moving average Wednesday and, after a likely short period of consolidation, looks to be in a good position to extend its gains to 1.16 near term after sailing through the psychologically important 1.15 level. Above there, the 1.1622 high touched on October 16 would be a possible second target.
$$$$
Meanwhile, to the downside, there is support at 1.1448 from the 100-day moving average, at 1.1317 from a rising trendline and at the 1.1299 January 2 low.
$$$$
Chart by IG (You can click on it for a larger image)
$$$$
From a fundamental perspective, EURUSD is benefiting from a weaker USD after the minutes of the US rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting on December 18-19 that implied interest rates could be on hold through March or even longer. The minutes reported that many FOMC members felt the central bank “could afford to be patient about further policy firming”.
$$$$
In addition, trade talks between the US and China seem to be progressing, although there has been little detail yet, potentially weakening demand for safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar. A lack of progress on US President Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall between the US and Mexico has so far failed to affect the USD much, and nor have the partial US government shutdown or talk of further moves to stimulate the Chinese economy.
$$$$
This session, the European Central Bank’s minutes of its December 12-13 Governing Council meeting at 1230 GMT are unlikely to affect market prices but there could be some movement after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks to the Economic Club of Washington at 1700 GMT.

German GDP shocks, UK inflation up next.

We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and GBP.
$$$$
After speaking with her Cabinet ministers on a one-to-one basis last night to try and persuade them to sign up to the new Brexit draft agreement. UK PM Theresa May will invite her Cabinet to vote on the deal this afternoon, with plenty of sceptics sitting around the table. If the deal is agreed, then it is likely that there will be an EU Council meeting next to update member states on the current state of Brexit before a potential EU27 meeting on November 24 - 25. After this the UK Parliament will vote on the agreement.
$$$$
If UK PM May does not get this agreement passed, her political future is at stake. A leadership challenge will likely be launched by one of the staunch Brexiteers who would likely gather enough votes to win. This would then lead to an increased chance of a no-deal and the UK leaving the EU on WTO trade terms. If PM does not survive, Sterling will likely fall sharply.
$$$$
Against this backdrop, Sterling remains edgy with 50+ pip swings on any political tweets or news flashes. The Brexit barometer, EURGBP, remains stable for now and still sits in a defined downtrend. If PM May gets approval this afternoon, EURGBP is expected to continue to decline with 0.86210 the initial downside target, while a negative response will see 0.8810 tested.
$$$$
EURGBP: Pending Short – Downtrend Intact 
$$$$
EURGBP will also be under downside pressure from this morning’s poor German Q3 GDP which saw the country contract further than expected – negative 0.2% against +0.5% in the prior quarter – while the annual reading fell to 1.1% against expectations of 1.3% and a prior reading of 2.0%.

The 10-year German/Italy government bond spread – an indicator of market stress – widened out by around 10 basis points to 313bps.

Both GBP and EUR could extend their advances against USD after the US mid-term elections, according to retail trader sentiment data.
$$$$
The figures for EURUSD show 55.4% of traders are net-long, with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.24 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since October 1, when EURUSD traded near 1.16344; the price has moved 1.5% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 20.3% lower than yesterday and 21.9% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 16.6% higher than yesterday and 23.4% higher from last week.
$$$$
At DailyFX, we typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EURUSD prices may continue to fall. Yet traders are less net-long than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current EURUSD price trend may soon extend higher despite the fact traders remain net-long.

For GBPUSD, the data show 61.2% of traders are net-long, with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.58 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since September 20, when GBPUSD traded near 1.31089; the price has moved 0.2% higher since then. The percentage of traders net-long is now its lowest since October 17, when GBPUSD traded near 1.31008.

EUR Analysis and Talking Points:

See our quarterly EUR forecast to learn what will drive prices through mid-year! 
$$$$
The Euro has continued to track higher this morning, taking out the 50% Fibonacci Retracement at 1.1447 (rise from 1.0340-1.2555) and subsequently making test of the 1.15 handle. The Midterm election saw Republicans maintain a majority in the Senate, however, lost the House of Representatives to the Democrats, which in increases the likelihood of a political gridlock and thus has weighed on the US Dollar. Alongside this, the Trump administrations domestic agenda (Fiscal stimulus and tax reform) could face increased hurdles providing a USD negative outlook. Much of the upside in the Euro has stemmed from a bout of short covering with bearish bets at $4bln in the run up to the election.
$$$$
The upside in the Euro against the greenback has ran into notable resistance at the 1.15 handle with a huge 6.3bln vanilla option, which is set to expire on Friday, has curbed further upside in the pair for now. Alongside this, support is seen at 1.1425, whereby a 2.8bln vanilla option expiry sits at.

Euro Bulls Need Topside Break to Confirm 1.13 Bottom
$$$$
Despite the notable rise from 1.13, to confirm a positive outlook for the pair, EURUSD bulls will be looking for a break and close above 1.1650. Consequently, with Italian politics, alongside an evident slowdown in the Eurozone remains prominent, while the Federal Reserve’s tighter monetary policy offers attractiveness for EURUSD shorts given the interest rate differential. The Euro still has some way to go before the outlook looks modestly bullish. Reminder, the latest FOMC meeting is scheduled tomorrow evening, whereby rates are expected to remain unchanged, however increased scrutiny may be placed on the IOER.

EUR/USD to Rise Further? FOMC, Italy and Brexit May Bring Losses	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/11/08/EURUSD-to-Rise-Further-FOMC-Italy-and-Brexit-May-Bring-Losses.html	1541655000	"
EUR/USD has staged a recovery, but upside momentum may lack follow-through
$$$$
Positive RSI divergence, failure to test Augustlow may signal near-term Euro strength
$$$$
FOMC rate decision, Brexit negotiations and Italian budget woes to bring volatility
"	"
The Euro is enjoying a brief respite from the losses sustained against the US Dollar for the majority of this year. However, whether this upswing will continue or if it is corrective within a broader downtrend remains to be seen. Here’s what some of the DailyFX analysts think:
$$$$
EUR/USD’s failure to test the August-low of 1.1301 may signal near-term bullish price action, according to Currency Analyst David Song. In addition, positive RSI divergence breaking out of a bearish formation in September may point towards a rally. A daily close above the 38.2% expansion at 1.1510 could indicate a return towards the Fibonacci overlap regions near 1.1640 to 1.1680, which are the 23.6% expansion and 50% retracement levels, respectively. 
$$$$
EUR/USD Chart (Daily)
$$$$
On the other hand, the currency pair could face a bearish reversal as it remains below prior October support levels ranging from 1.1488-1.1500. In addition, EUR/USD still maintains a descending trend line connecting swing-highs from late-September towards the middle of last month on a four-hour price chart. Currency Strategist James Stanley explains that this bearish behaviour, in addition to fundamental risk from EU negotiations regarding Italy’s budget and Brexit, may spell further losses for the Euro. 
$$$$
EUR/USD Chart (4-hour)
$$$$
Looking ahead, EUR/USD eyes a packed docket of economic data over the next few weeks. The greenback could rise on the upcoming FOMC rate decision and forward guidance, in addition to preliminary consumer sentiment for the month of November. Meanwhile, the Euro may face volatility from the release of local 3Q GDP and employment figures, but will be more interested in developments in ongoing Brexit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union, as well as the Italian budget crisis.

EURUSD Outlook Still Positive Technically After Mixed EU Forecasts	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/11/08/EURUSD-Outlook-Still-Positive-Technically-After-Mixed-EU-Forecasts.html	1541673000	"
EURUSD is well placed technically to make further gains. 
$$$$
However, that technical strength was only partly reinforced Thursday by mixed reports on the Eurozone economy from the European Commission and the European Central Bank.
"	"
EURUSD remains in the uptrend that has been in place since the end of last month and, despite losses late Wednesday, is well positioned to climb higher within the rising channel that has taken it from a low of 1.1302 on October 31 to its current level around 1.1425.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
Despite continuing concerns about the dispute between Italy and the EU over the Italian budget, a rally back towards channel resistance above 1.15 is now possible and the downside should be limited near-term by channel support just above 1.14 and then at the 1.1302 October 31 low.
$$$$
Traders looking to buy the pair might therefore wish to take profits if the 1.15 level is reached and place a stop at 1.13 to limit losses in case the price slides lower.
$$$$
Fundamentally, the outlook for the Eurozone economy is mixed according to reports issued Thursday by the European Commission and the European Central Bank, which remains on course to tighten Eurozone monetary policy in due course.
$$$$
The Commission forecast that Eurozone economic growth will reach 2.1% this year but will then ease to 1.9% next year and 1.7% in 2020. The Commission is concerned about US economic policies and Brexit, as well as Italy’s spending plans.
$$$$
However, the ECB, in its latest Economic Bulletin, was more upbeat in its forecasts for the Eurozone economy. In a report that is essentially positive for the Euro, the Eurozone’s central bank said “the incoming information that has become available since the Governing Council’s monetary policy meeting in September, while somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the Euro area economy and gradually rising inflation pressures.”

EURUSD Trampled by a Rampant US Dollar, Hits a Fresh 17-Month Low	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/11/12/EURUSD-Trampled-by-a-Rampant-US-Dollar-Hits-a-Fresh-17-Month-Low-.html	1542013200	"

We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
EURUSD has started the week heavily in the red with sellers taking the pair back down to levels last seen 17-months ago. Currently trading around 1.1250, EURUSD is being forced lower by continued strength in the US dollar with the US Dollar Basket (DXY) now at a 17-month high after breaking through noted resistance. The greenback is rallying on the back of strong economic backdrop with higher US interest rates expected over the course of the next 12-18 months. The Fed Funds rate is expected to be hiked by another 0.25% in December – the fourth such hike this year – while expectations are for the Fed to hike rates at least another three times in 2019. 
$$$$
On the other side of the pair, the Euro is coming under pressure as the EU economic backdrop continues to weaken. On Wednesday, provisional German Q3 q/q GDP is likely to contract for the first time since Q1 2015. Expectations are for a reading of -0.1%, compared to 0.5% in Q2, while annual GDP is set to be nearly cut in half to 1.2% from 2.3%.
$$$$
The next leg of the Italian budget saga will begin this week and again may force the single currency lower. The EU set the Italian government a deadline of November 13 to come up with a revised budget plan but ,as yet, Rome has refused to budge on its original, contentious, plan. While the budget row continues, Italian borrowing costs continue to creep higher with the 10-year Italian government bond now yielding 3.42%, over 300 basis points more than comparable German debt.

EURUSD Stabilizing Ahead of Italian Budget Deadline	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/11/13/EURUSD-Stabilizing-Ahead-of-Italian-Budget-Deadline.html	1542103200	"
The European Commission has given Italy a deadline of today to present it with a new Budget.
$$$$
Ahead of that, EURUSD is off its lows after hitting its weakest level for more than a year.
"	"
EURUSD has climbed modestly in Europe Tuesday after reaching its lowest level since June 27, 2017 Monday on concerns about a row between Italy and the European Commission over the Italian Budget.
$$$$
Rome’s 2019 Budget proposals have already been rejected by the Commission, which has given it a deadline of today to present it with new plans or potentially face disciplinary proceedings.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
However, EURUSD remains below the psychologically important 1.13 level and Italy seems unlikely to present revised plans that would be acceptable to the Commission. The country’s parliamentary Budget watchdog has forecast a 2019 Budget deficit of 2.6% of GDP, rather than the 2.4% forecast by the Government, and these factors will make a stronger recovery in EURUSD unlikely near-term.
$$$$
Italy’s 10-year and 30-year government bond yields rose to their highest levels for two weeks ahead of the Tuesday deadline and further gains seem probable if, as expected, Rome makes no material changes to its Budget plans.

EURUSD Downtrend Continues, Amplified by German Economic Weakness	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/11/13/EURUSD-Downtrend-Continues-Amplified-by-a-Weaker-German-Economy-.html	1542106800	"
German ZEW readings point to a continued slowdown in the economy. 
$$$$
German Q3 GDP release may show the first negative quarter since Q2 2014.
"	"
We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
The latest German ZEW readings highlight the slowdown in Europe’s largest economy with the Economic Sentiment Indicator showing a marginal increase to -24.1. The reading remains heavily in negative territory and well below the long-term average of 22.7. In addition, the assessment of the current economic situation in Germany fell by 11.9 points to 58.2.
$$$$
According to ZEW President Wambach, “The figures for industrial production, retail sales and foreign trade in Germany all point towards a weak development of the German economy in the third quarter. This is reflected by the fact that the assessment of the current situation has experienced a decline. The expectations of the survey participants for the coming six months do not show any improvement. This means that, at the moment, they do not expect to see a speedy recovery of the currently weak development of the economy.”
$$$$
While the German figures point to regional weakness, the indicator for the current economic situation in the Eurozone dropped by 13.8 to a level of 18.2. “As a result, the outlook for the Eurozone has deteriorated even more than it has for Germany”, according to the ZEW President.
$$$$
The first look at German Q3 GDP is released on Wednesday and is expected to show the first negative quarter since Q2 2014. This may well press EURUSD below 1.1200 and back towards the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.1187. A break below opens the way to 1.1109 before the 1.0810 – 1.0840 area comes into play.

ECB President Mario Draghi, speaking in Frankfurt, said that while the euro-zone economy continues to grow, the outlook is becoming increasingly cloudy. Draghi said that if firms start to become increasingly uncertain about the growth and inflation outlook, ‘this would affect the speed which underlying inflation picks up and therefore the inflation path that we expect to see in the quarters ahead’. The ECB has already said that it will end its quantitative easing program at the end of December after pumping in nearly EUR2.5 billion of liquidity in the economy. Expectations of an interest rate hike after summer 2019 now look likely to be pushed back if growth and inflation stall. The German economy contracted in Q3 official data showed this week, a sign that ongoing trade disputes are weighing on Europe’s growth engine.

$$$$
Things just got a whole lot worse for UK PM Theresa May after her Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, handed in his resignation. Raab said that he ‘cannot in good conscience support the terms proposed for our deal with the EU’. Raab pointedly added that ‘No democratic nation has ever signed up to be bound by such an extensive regime, imposed externally without any democratic control over the laws to be applied, nor the ability to decide to exit the arrangement’.
$$$$As we go to press Works and Pensions Secretary Esther MCVey has also resigned. $$$$
UK PM Theresa May is now under increasing pressure and may face a call to resign at any time. The influential Conservative 1922 Committee need to receive 48 letters of no confidence from Conservative MPs to spark a leadership contest, with many political commentators saying that only a couple of more votes are needed to trigger a contest. The PM is coming under attack from all political sides with her early mantra of ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ being turned against her and her position is looking increasing untenable.

Dominic Raab’s resignation knocked Sterling sharply lower and back to levels last seen two weeks ago against the US dollar. Support at 1.2785 is now coming under pressure which would leave the way open to a fresh test of the recent 17-month low of 1.2662, made in mid-August.

EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
The recent USD selling amid cautious Fed rhetoric from both Powell and Clarida has provided upside risks for the Euro. On Friday, Powell had highlighted that the US could face headwinds going into next year over slowing demand, alongside fading fiscal stimulus. This dovish commentary had been echoed by Clarida who stated that the slowing of the global economy is becoming a headwind. This in turn has seen Fed Fund futures flatten with markets pricing in 57bps worth of tightening by December 2019, this is in stark contrast to the Fed’s current dot plot projection, which implies 100bps worth of tightening (1 more 2018 hike and three 2019 hikes). Given the cautious Fed commentary, eyes will be on Fed’s Williams who is scheduled to speak at 15:45GMT. 
$$$$
The showdown between Italy and the European Commission may see Euro gains limited as the EC look to discipline Italy over its 2019 budget. On Wednesday, the EC will complete its assessment of Italy’s revised budget and publish an opinion. However, given that the key details (namely the budget deficit target) remain unchanged, it is likely that the opinion will be unfavourable, meaning that they EC will look to begin the excessive debt procedure which may lead to fines for Italy. As such, rising tensions continue to provide downside risks for EURUSD.
$$$$
On Thursday, markets will digest the latest ECB monetary policy meeting minutes. While the ECB look set to end QE purchases by the year-end, focus is beginning to centre on rate hike expectations, which have reduced in light of the increased uncertainty regarding Brexit and Italy. Alongside this, focus in the minutes will be on the number of council members who suggest that risks to the Eurozone are titled to the downside. As a reminder, at the most recent monetary policy meeting, the central bank left its forward guidance unchanged (risks broadly balanced), however, with an evident slowdown in Germany (GDP contracting for the first time in 3 years) amid the knock on effects from trade wars, several members may begin to fret over current environment.

$$$$
Latest EURUSD rally is running out of steam and may reverse lower.
"	"
We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
The recent mini-rally in EURUSD has come to a halt after Italy reaffirmed that it would make no changes to its contentious 2019 budget, sparking fears that the EU could commence disciplinary procedures against Italy. The European Commission is said to be releasing a report on Wednesday. In advance of this, the Italian/German 10-year yield spread has widened out further, putting pressure on the single currency.   
$$$$
Higher Italian bond yields will increase Rome’s borrowing costs, putting the country’s finances under additional pressure. German government bond yields - the go to Euro-Zone haven – are now negative all the way out to seven years as worries grow, meaning borrowers are paying the German government for the privilege of buying German debt.
$$$$
ECB President Mario Draghi warned last week that inflation in the single-bloc may not be rising as fast as previously expected, lending credence to market views that the central bank may have to dial back any interest rate hike until the end of 2019. The German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz also recently admitted that the German economy – the Euro-Zone’s engine - faces several headwinds including Brexit, confirming fears over a continued slowdown.

"	"
Build confidence in your Euro trading strategy with our free guide! 
$$$$
The war of words between Rome and Brussels is intensifying with EU policymakers heading into unchartered waters. After two budget submissions were rejected, the EU Commission has decided to meet on Wednesday Nov. 21st to discuss the possibility of opening up a case for the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP).
$$$$
The punishments include a fine of 0.2 percent of GDP. Normally, this process would only begin in April of 2019. However, the Commission may be able to expedite the process and begin imposing fines as early as this month. The punishment would take the form of a non-interest bearing deposit. This sanction could only be avoided if more than half of all Eurozone finance ministers reject it within 10 days of adoption. 
$$$$
If the deposit is made, the Italian government is given 3-6 months to implement the necessary reforms. If the proper changes are not made, the deposit turns into a fine. If the government refuses to pay the initial deposit and subsequent fines, the issue would likely be taken up to the European Court of Justice.  
$$$$
Another punitive measure may also entail freezing Italy’s access to funds such as the European Stability Mechanism and the European Structural and Investment Fund. They may also be denied access to the Outright Monetary Transaction, a process whereby the ECB buys the bonds issued by member states from secondary sovereign bond markets (although this has not been used in practice so far).  
$$$$
Uncertainty about how policymakers will navigate these uncharted waters is likely to widen the spread between German and Italian bond yields further, implying increased reluctance to lend to Rome versus Berlin. It may also encourage capital to flow out of the Euro until clearer bearings may be established, sending the single currency broadly lower.

EURUSD Price Consolidating, More Gains Possible	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/11/21/EURUSD-Price-Consolidating-More-Gains-Possible.html	1542798000	"
Concerns about global economic growth, Apple and US/China trade tensions are currently failing to support USD as risk-averse traders look instead to currencies such as JPY and CHF for a safe haven.
$$$$
According to the OECD, global growth is slowing amid rising trade and financial risks.
$$$$
Against this background, the USD price will likely fall back further near-term, boosting EURUSD, with 1.16 a possible target for the pair.
$$$$
That's despite a report that the European Commission has, as expected, rejected the Italian government's budget plan for 2019.
"	"
EURUSD has been looking steadier over the past few sessions after its falls earlier in the year and a further move higher is now possible, especially if a compromise between Rome and Brussels over the Italian budget can be reached and the US tech sector stabilizes after its recent sharp losses caused by concerns over iPhone sales.
$$$$Meanwhile, concerns about a slowing global economy are failing to support the US Dollar.$$$$Global economic growth remains strong but has passed its recent peak and faces escalating risks including rising trade tensions and tightening financial conditions, according to the OECD's latest Economic Outlook, published Wednesday.$$$$The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development revised down its growth forecasts for next year for most of the world's major economies and said global GDP is now expected to expand by only 3.5% in 2019, compared with the 3.7% forecast in last May's Outlook, and by 3.5% in 2020.$$$$Meanwhile, the European Commission has rejected the Italian budget plan for 2019, according to Italy's ANSA newsagency. However, that was widely expected so has had little negative impact on the Euro.$$$$ANSA reported the Commission as saying: ""Our analysis suggests that the debt rule must be considered to have not been respected... We conclude that the opening of a procedure for excessive deficit based on the debt is therefore justified."" $$$$Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte responded by saying he remained convinced about the validity of the budget package and would meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels Saturday to discuss the situation.$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
From a technical perspective, the EURUSD price will need to break through the 50-day moving average at 1.1463, the November high at 1.1500, the 100-day moving average at 1.1528 and trendline resistance around 1.16 if it is to break above the falling channel in place since mid-April.
$$$$
That could be difficult but a move up to the 1.16 level is perfectly possible and, if it breaks above it, the next target would be the October highs at 1.1622/25. Meanwhile, the pair has near-term support from the20-day moving average just below the current price, at 1.13 and at November’s 1.1216 low.

Retail trader sentiment data are positive too, currently sending a bullish signal for the pair.

Currently, Italy’s case is at a point where the Commission will look to propose a set of measures that must be implemented and set a timeframe for by which the Italian government must deliver by. If Italy fails to make progress in implementing the proposed measures, the European Commission can impose a sanction, that may involve a fine of 0.2-0.5% of GDP.
$$$$
However, given that yesterday’s decision by the European Commission was widely expected and with Deputy PM Salvini providing a somewhat conciliatory tone towards the EU, BTP yields in fact dipped, while the Euro also found a bid.
$$$$
At 1230GMT, the market will digest the latest ECB monetary policy meeting minutes. While the ECB look undeterred by the current backdrop to end QE purchases by the year-end, the focus is shifting towards forward guidance on rate hikes. In light of the increased uncertainty which has sparked a sell off in equity markets, rate hike expectations have receded, with a September rate hike now seen at a 30% likelihood (Prev. 70%). Heading into the monetary policy decision, investors had been looking out for whether the ECB would alter its forward guidance to state that risks to growth are tilting to the downside, however, this was left unchanged (risks broadly balanced). As such, focus in the minutes will be on whether several members indeed see that the outlook is deteriorating, particularly given the slowing in the European powerhouse, Germany, which last week showed GDP contracting for the first time in 3yrs amid the knock on effect from trade wars.

PMIs indicate EU Q4 growth of 0.3%
$$$$
EURUSD struggling to make a decisive move higher.
"	"
We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
The November Markit PMIs highlighted that business activity in the euro area grew at its weakest level in nearly four years on weaker order book growth and slipping exports. According to Markit, the slowdown in business activity was most pronounced in the manufacturing sector where output rose only ‘marginally’. 
$$$$
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit noted: “The cooling of Eurozone business growth to a four year low adds to signs that the economy faces a disappointing end of the year. Manufacturing remains the main area of weakness, linked in part to having been hit hard once again by deteriorating exports.” 
$$$$
He added, “As such, the survey data suggest that the weakness of GDP in the third quarter may not have been a blip, and that the underlying trend is one of slower economic growth. The PMI readings so far in the fourth quarter are indicative of 0.3% GDP growth, with forward-looking indicators such as new orders and future expectations remaining worryingly subdued.”

Fed Powell dampens expectations, but multiple rate hikes remain on the table.
$$$$
EURUSD remains in a downtrend while the US dollar basket remains bullish.
"	"
We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
Fed Chair Powell gave markets a nudge yesterday evening suggesting that the current level of rates is just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy. Investors took this as a dovish shift, but o second reading the wording of Powell’s speech refuted that. While in September Powell said that rates ‘were a long way from neutral’, yesterday he widened this by saying that rates were just below the ‘broad range of estimates’ of the level of rates that would be neutral for the economy. With the broad range of 2.5% to 3.5% and a current Fed Funds rate of 2% to 2.25%, this gives a median of 3 to 4 rate hikes of 0.25% before we hit Powell’s target.
$$$$
The US Dollar basket (DXY) dipped lower but remains in a strong uptrend, underpinned by interest rate expectations. The basket has rallied from a low of just under 88 in February this year and currently trades at 96.20, just off its recent 1near 18-month high at 97.16. While a further small dip cannot be discounted, the firm trend higher will provide support for the US dollar around the 95.50 – 96.00 area.
$$$$
EURUSD remains pointed to the downside with a series of unbroken lower highs dominating the charts from late-September. The pair need to break and close above the 1.1470 – 1.1475 area to break this trend before 1.1625 and 1.1660 come into view. On the downside support appears at 1.1300 ahead of 1.1215 and 1.1187.

$$$$
For a more in-depth analysis on EUR, check out the Q4 Forecast for EUR
$$$$
Given yesterday’s drop in German inflation, risks had been tilted to the downside for today’s Eurozone inflation figures, which confirmed as much. The headline figure fell 0.2ppts to 2%, while the core reading fell below expectations to 1.0%. Expectations of a “vigorous” pick up in core inflation voiced by ECB President Draghi back in September is still yet to be seen and given the sizeable drop in oil prices over the past 2-months, the inflation outlook has deteriorated. Elsewhere, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1%, expectations had been for a drop to 8%.
$$$$
Source: Refinitiv.
$$$$
Despite core inflation remaining subdued, the ECB will be undeterred from bringing an end to its bond buying program at the end of the year. However, this will keep the ECB hawks quiet on the rate hike front. That said, money markets have priced out a 10bps rate hike next year with markets seeing a 60% chance that the ECB will lift off in December 2019.
$$$$
Month-end demand for Dollars has placed the Euro on the backfoot, coupled with the disappointing inflation readings. Alongside this, today marks another Federal Reserve balance sheet unwind, which typically provides support to the USD.

EURUSD Rises as Italy Backs Down on Budget	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/11/26/EURUSD-Rises-as-Italy-Backs-Down-on-Budget.html	1543227600	"
Increasing Signs of Eurozone Slowdown
$$$$
Budget Deficit Target Reduction 
"	"
EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
If you are trading the Euro, check out the quarterly forecast
$$$$
The German IFO survey dipped in-line with the recent ZEW and PMI figures, reducing hopes of a year-end rebound and instead providing increasing signs of a slowdown in the Eurozone amid the backdrop of political uncertainty (Brexit, Italy) and trade wars. Alongside this, the expectations component saw the largest drop, which in turn suggests that the slowdown is here to stay. However, the Euro has remained somewhat resilient thus far.  
$$$$
The Euro is notably firmer with Italian bond yields dipping after reports that the Italian government are discussing reducing the 2019 deficit target to 2-2.1% from the current 2.4% target. This was also followed by comments from Salvini who added that Brussels provided a positive feedback over potentially lowering its 2019 deficit target. That said, Italy’s Tria, Conte, Di Maio and Salvini are to meet at 18:30GMT in order to discuss the budget. On the back of this, the Euro has been lifted from 1.1330 to highs of 1.1380, while the Bund-BTP spreads drops below 300bps.
$$$$
As a reminder, the EU had last week rejected Italy’s resubmitted budget and stated that they would press ahead with the “excessive deficit procedure”. However, if indeed the Italian government confirms it will reduce its budget deficit target then this increases the likelihood that it may be passed by the European Commission, thus providing support for the Euro as Italian bond yields drop.

USD Price Dip on US-China Trade Ceasefire Could be Brief	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/12/03/USD-Price-Dip-on-US-China-Trade-Ceasfire-Could-be-Brief.html	1543827600	"
The US and Chinese Presidents have called a 90-day truce in their trade war.
$$$$
That has weakened the USD price but it could yet recover on doubts that the two countries can bridge their differences.
"	"
The USD price has weakened in early European trade Monday after US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to halt additional tariffs and keep their trade war from escalating. That has boosted risk appetite but there are widespread concerns that a deal might not be reached within 90 days and that could help the US currency rally.
$$$$
So far, EURUSD is higher, USDJPY is down and GBPUSD is up, lowering the USD index (DXY) against a basket of other currencies.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
Trump also said in a tweet Sunday that China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US. Currently the tariff is 40% and any deal would also be positive for risk appetite, which has already helped risk-on currencies like AUD, as well as the crude oil price and stocks.
$$$$
Crude has been boosted additionally by an expected OPEC agreement to extend output cuts. However, substantial progress in the US-China trade talks seems unlikely within the 90-day period and the truce could just postpone hostilities, leaving room for risk appetite to sour again in the weeks ahead.

The USD price is weakening further: down Monday on news of a US-China trade war ceasefire, down Tuesday on misgivings that a long-term deal can be agreed.
$$$$
That may be because the US Treasury yield curve has flattened and partly inverted, seen by some as a harbinger of recession.
"	"
The USD price is easing again Tuesday as doubts emerge that a long-term US-China trade war deal can be reached after slipping back Monday on news of a temporary truce. US President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping have decided to hold off from imposing new tariffs for 90 days while they negotiate an agreement.
$$$$
However, concerns surfaced Tuesday about whether a long-term agreement is achievable. That might have been expected to give the US Dollar a lift given its status as a safe haven when risk aversion rises. Instead, it dropped again, implying that other forces are influencing it too.

$$$$
As the chart of EURUSD above shows, the pair is extending its gains as the US Dollar weakens and from a technical perspective has broken to the upside from a triangle pattern, implying further gains are now possible.
$$$$
That could be in part because the US Treasury yield curve has flattened and partly inverted.
$$$$

$$$$
The curve is now flatter than it was both a month ago and a year ago, while the curve has inverted between two years and five years, sometimes seen as a warning of a possible recession that would lead to lower US interest rates and reduce the attractions of the Dollar.
$$$$
While this seems unlikely at present, it perhaps suggests that the outlook for USD is less positive than it seemed as recently as Monday.

Stock Selloff Lingers. USD May Pare Losses on CPI Data, Fed Speech	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/10/11/Stock-Selloff-Lingers-USD-May-Pare-Losses-on-CPI-Data-Fed-Speech.html	1539234000	"

$$$$
As anticipated, Asia Pacific benchmark stock indexes echoed the market selloff from Wall Street where the S&P 500 suffered its largest daily drop in about 8 months. The Nikkei 225 shed over 4% from its price as it set itself up for its worst performance over the course of five days since February. China’s Shanghai Composite tumbled 4.34% and Australia’s ASX 200 declined as much as 2.34%. 
$$$$
US government bond yields continued falling as December Fed rate hike bets kept deteriorating. Despite the flight to safety, the US Dollar failed to fully capitalize as the world’s reserve currency. During periods of intense risk aversion, the markets tend to prioritize safety as opposed to the reach for yields. In fact, the performance in FX seemed to echo what was seen during the US trading session.
$$$$
There, Brexit optimism bets thanks to relatively supportive comments from Chief EU negotiator Michael Barnier kept the Euro and British Pound afloat against the US Dollar. Looking at the charts below, this trading dynamic continued during Thursday’s APAC session. Equally weighted EUR and GBP indexes gained as the USD basket fell short.
$$$$
USD Basket Versus GBP Basket
$$$$
USD Basket Versus EUR Basket
$$$$
This could have been as a result of Asia/Pacific markets having their chance to react to Brexit optimism, especially if these are bets ahead of next week’s EU summit which takes place on the 17th and 18th. Note that the anti-risk Japanese Yen was actually cautiously weaker against its major counterparts while the Swiss Franc gained, perhaps reflecting the more optimal regional haven bids given updates out of Europe.
$$$$
With that said, we may see the global stock selloff continue taking its course over the remainder of the day. But there are a couple of event risks that may bolster the US Dollar, offering it a chance to pare losses. The first is September’s US CPI report. Local economic data has been tending to outperform relative to economists’ expectations. An upside surprise there may reignite hawkish Fed monetary policy bets.
$$$$
Meanwhile Kansas City Fed President Esther George will present a speech later today. There, she may continue reiterating their hawkish stance despite the correction in stocks. The central bank has acknowledged before that ‘some assets are at the upper end of their historical ranges’. Thus, this may not be much of a concern for them in the near-term. This could reignite gains in the US Dollar.
$$$$
The US Dollar continues making downside progress after a break under a near-term rising support line. At the time of this writing, current resistance seems to be holding up at 95.26 which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement. A descent through it exposes the 50% midpoint at 94.98. Meanwhile a reversal would place 95.55 – 95.71 as the near-term range of resistance before the current October highs.

EURUSDhas nudged back above 1.1600 in early trade but is finding it difficult to keep this level despite a currently weak US dollar. The US dollar index (DXY) remains around 94.60, two-points lower than its recent 16-month high of 96.60 made on August 15, despite expectations of further interest-rate hikes ahead.
$$$$
The Italian parliament late Thursday passed the new budget bill and will now forward it on to the government to be approved. The new budget will then be submitted to the EU Commission who have already voiced grave concerns over Italy’s deficit target which they say will break the single-block’s rules. A further escalation in the war of words between Italy and the EU will weigh on the euro and make further headway difficult.
$$$$
In a timely intervention Thursday, the ECB said that it rules would prevent it from coming to Italy’s rescue if they run out of money, unless the country has already agreed a rescue program with the European Union. Italian banks are thought to have around EUR375 billion of government debt on their books which they use as collateral at the ECB for funding. The recent rise in Italian bond yields will make it increasingly expensive for the government to service its debts.

The release of the latest FOMC minutes later today should give us a clue to the Fed’s thinking for interest rates and the economy for 2019. With a December 0.25% interest rate hike already priced into the market, Fed Chair Powell’s statement will be carefully parsed for his thoughts on inflation and the trajectory of rate hikes in 2019. Powell’s commentary will especially interesting considering the latest outburst from US President Trump who complained that the US rates are being hiked too fast.
$$$$
On the other side of the pair, the eagerly-awaited EU Summit starts with no-deal in sight. Over the past two-three weeks, expectations have grown that a framework of a deal may be announced this week but that now seems to be off the table as the Irish border impasse has yet to be resolved. Both sides are refusing to budge on their position over a border backstop and talk is growing of a no-deal Brexit, although this may just be negotiating tactics.

The path of least resistance for EURUSD is lower with both sides of the pair contributing to the negative sentiment. The US dollar side of the pair is seeing renewed buying and strength after Wednesday’s FOMC statement showed that a few Fed members “expected that policy would need to become modestly restrictive for a time and a number judged that it would necessary to temporarily raise the federal funds rate above their assessments of its longer-run level.” In short, US interest rates expectations may need to be re-priced higher.

The US dollar basket (DXY) is currently within 50 pips of a new two-month high – 95.20 against 95.70 - and the technical outlook suggests even higher prices with the August 15 high at 96.60 the next target.
$$$$
On the other side, the ongoing Italian Budget battle with the EU will continue to keep a lid on the common-currency. Italian government bond yields will continue to move higher – with fears of further ratings downgrades around the corner – pushing Italy’s funding and debt servicing costs ever higher. If you add in Brexit concerns and ongoing worries over EU-US trade, it will be hard to justify putting the Euro on any buy lists.

Check out the brand new Q4 FX forecast guides
$$$$
The Euro remains under pressure and is heading towards the 1.14 handle amid the concerns over the Italian budget, setting the EU and Italy on a collision course. Yesterday saw reports that the EU commission had warned that Italy’s budget is a serious and particularly non-compliant proposal with EU rules, which in turn increases the risk that EU could reject the Italian budget unless it is amended. In reaction to the negative sentiment surrounding the Italian budget, Italian bond yields have been surging with the 10yr rising some 9bps today. This in turn has taken the spread against the bund to the widest level in over 5yrs at 330bps and moving ever so closer to the 350-400bps fear zone.
$$$$
Italian politics remains the dominant driver of the single currency and will seemingly continue to do so in the upcoming week with Italy given until Monday to reply to the EU, while eyes will also be on the rating agencies as they evaluate Italy’s budget (S&P and Moody’s to report next week). A downgrade by the rating agencies could see renewed pressure on Italian and thus weighing on Italian assets further (Italian banks).
$$$$
The move lower in the Euro has been exacerbated by the recent rise in peripheral bond yields (most notably, Spain and Portugal), which in turn have raised concerns over contagion risks with both Spanish and Portuguese bond yields trading at the highest level against the German bund since May.

Credit rating agency Moody’s cut Italian government debt by one notch to Baa3 from Baa2, one notch above junk status. The outlook was changed to stable, indicating that another ratings cut is not expected in the near future.Italian bond investors took this outlook change as a positive sign and sent BTP bond yields sharply lower (prices higher). Italian 10-year yields fell to 3.375% from around 3.75% last Thursday. This gave the single currency an early leg higher, but it is unlikely that yields will shift dramatically lower as the Italian budget is still under discussion with the EU.

Ahead, the latest ECB meeting will see all monetary policy levers left untouched. The central bank is expected to give its views on Italy, the impact of a hard-Brexit and the recent down-turn in the euro-zone economy.

EURGBP continues to re-trace recent losses now trades at the top of the trading channel, started off the August 26 high at 0.90987. The pair have bounced off the October 10 low at 0.87233 and currently trade at 0.88230, the top of the channel.

Italian Bond Yields Lower But Euro Remains Weak	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/10/23/Italian-Bond-Yields-Lower-But-Euro-Remains-Weak.html	1540282920	"
Italian bond yields steady for now.   
$$$$
EU Commission may ask Italy to revise their plans.
"	"
We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
The EU Commission is expected to ask Italy to re-submit its recent budget proposal - taking into account the blocs rules – paving the way for further disagreement between the two parties, and volatility in the common currency. The Italian government has already said that it will not budge from its stated position while the EU Commission has already warned Italy of its serious concerns, something echoed by rating’s agency Moody’s who cut Italy’s government debt rating recently to one notch above junk level. 
$$$$
According to reports, the EU Commission is likely to issue a ‘negative opinion’ and ask Rome to resubmit an improved budget which address the EU’s concerns.
$$$$
Italian 10-year bond yields have moved higher over the last few months, and while they have drifted off their recent high print around 3.85%, the uptrend remains in place and points to higher yields/lower prices. 
$$$$
EURUSD remains at risk of any further escalation in the EU/Italy budget stand-off with investors shunning Italian bonds and buying high-quality German bonds instead. Lower German bond yields weaken the single currency, while higher Italian bond yields increase negative sentiment for the euro.
$$$$
EURUSD is also under pressure from an increasingly strong US dollar complex. Yesterday US President Trump spoke about a major tax cut for middle earners, ahead of the US mid-term elections, while Fed speak today from Kashkari, Bostic and Kaplan, and the release of the Fed Beige book tomorrow are likely to confirm the ongoing strength of the US dollar.
$$$$
EURUSD remains weak and a break below the 1.14322, the October 9 low, opens the way to the August 15 multi-month low at 1.13010.
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment data show that 60.6% of retail traders are long of EURUSD, a negative contrarian position. However, further daily and weekly net-longs give us a stronger bearish trading bias.

The latest IHS Markit Euro-Zone PMIs will make uncomfortable reading for Mario Draghi ahead of Thursday’s ECB meeting with the composite index missing expectations and falling to a 25-month low of 52.7 compared to last month’s 54.1. And according to Markit, economic growth in the Euro-Zone is slowing down sharply.
$$$$
‘The pace of Eurozone economic growth slipped markedly lower in October, with the PMI setting the scene for a disappointing end to the year. The survey is indicative of GDP growth waning to 0.3% in the fourth quarter, and forward-looking indicators, such as measures of future expectations and new business inflows, suggest further momentum could be lost in coming months' wrote Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. The slowdown is being led by a drop-in exports, linked to trade wars and tariffs, ‘which appear to have darkened the global economic environment and led to increased risk aversion.’
$$$$
And ominously for the ECB Williamson added, ‘the headline PMI has fallen to a level that would historically be consistent with a bias towards loosening monetary policy in order to prevent any further deterioration of economic growth’.
$$$$
Italian government bond yields remain near their multi-year highs after the EU Commission recently rejected the country’s contentious budget plan. The Italian government in reply said that the budget was designed for Italians and not for Brussels, leaving the way open for renewed disagreement – and higher yields - between the two over the next few weeks. The 10-yr Italian government bond currently yields 3.55%, up from 1.73% at the start of May this year.

Italy outlook revised lower to negative from stable by S&P, affirmed at ‘BBB’
$$$$
Fitch affirms UK at ‘AA’ stable outlook while Germany affirmed by S&P at ‘AAA’ stable
$$$$
The currency’s muted response is largely due to the report’s release time
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
After a week of trouble for equities, a final blow was dealt to global markets following the market’s close on Friday. Rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded Italy’s outlook to negative from stable amid ongoing budget disagreements with the European Union. 
$$$$
Conversely, S&P affirmed Germany at ‘AAA’ with a stable outlook. While Fitch ratings released their reports on the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. 
$$$$
Italy
$$$$
The EU member has become the focus of global markets as a showdown between the government in Rome and European Union officials in Brussels highlights the growing divide between the two parties. The budget disagreement is seen as a risk to the bloc’s stability and the common currency, resulting in sustained EUR/USD weakness as of late. Further, an identical outlook downgrade was issued last week by Moody’s.
$$$$
EUR/USD Price Chart Hourly, October 22nd – 26th
$$$$
Given the time of the report’s release, EUR/USD was largely indifferent as European banks were closed and the weekend had begun. While Friday’s immediate response may have been negligible, outlook cuts are often preludes to a ratings downgrade and thus a downgrade from two agencies is a worrisome sign for Italy and the European Union if an agreement is not met. 
$$$$
United Kingdom
$$$$
Also affirmed Friday was the United Kingdom. Fitch affirmed the nation at ‘AA’ with a negative outlook. Political divisions within the UK regarding the nation’s withdrawal from the EU and the framework for future EU-UK relations were cited as key reasons for the negative outlook. The Pound was similarly unresponsive.

Germany
$$$$
Unsurprisingly, Standard & Poor’s affirmed Germany at ‘AAA’ with a stable outlook. Germany continues to show consistent economic strength and fiscal responsbility. 
$$$$
Norway, Sweden and Denmark
$$$$
The Nordic countries also had their ratings affirmed, all receiving an ‘AAA’ grade accompanied by stable outlooks. The affirmations were not surprising given the fiscal responsibility and economic condition of each country.
$$$$
Larger Implications
$$$$
While not immediately felt, the downgrade will surely weigh on global market sentiment. The outlook is effectively a vote of no-confidence from Standard & Poor’s and the Italian budget issues have been one of the headline issues plaguing markets in recent weeks.

Chancellor Merkel suffers losses in Hesse elections.
"	"
We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
EURUSDcontinues to cling to a1.1400 handle - but only just - as Italy and the EU remain at loggerheads over Italy’s contentious budget. The EU has said that Italy must make changes to its budget to comply with EU rules and present the new version by November 13. Italy is also in the headlines after ratings agency S&P cut its outlook on the country to negative but left its rating unchanged. Italian bonds picked up a little on the news, but yields stay elevated and the German/Italy 10-yr spread remains over 300bps.
$$$$
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition party suffered heavy losses in regional elections in the state of Hesse, just weeks after Merkel conservative allies were heavily beaten in Bavaria. Merkel will stand for re-election as party leader of the CDU in December and the latest voting may see her position come under increasing pressure.

EURUSD remains weak and is set to test the downside again. Last week’s low at 1.13358 remains in sight ahead of the recent 16-month low at 1.1300. The upside remains capped by 50% Fibonacci retracement at 1.14580. A raft of Euro-Zone hard data releases on Tuesday may well be the trigger for the next leg lower.

$$$$
The ECB will take centre stage today despite the fact that little is expected from the meeting itself. The central bank is expected to keep all rates unchanged and as such, focus will be firmly placed on President Draghi’s press conference and specifically in relation to the assessment regarding growth. The current guidance states that risks to the growth outlook are broadly balanced, which had been an upgrade from the previous guidance that risks to growth are tilted to the downside. Consequently, given the recent developments eyes will on whether Draghi reverts to previous guidance.
$$$$
Political uncertainty in Italy following their budget announcement has sparked Bund-BTP bond spreads to the widest level in 5yrs as the EU and Italy continue to clash over the budget, while rating downgrades from the likes of Moody’s has also increased concerns for Italian debt.
$$$$
Another cause of concern for Mario Draghi is the evident slowdown in the Eurozone as highlighted by the latest PMI data, in which the composite reading dropped to the lowest level in 25-months. The survey also indicated that GDP growth for Q4 is seen hovering around 0.3%. The impact of trade wars is seemingly having its impact on the Eurozone and most notably Germany, whereby the DAX is hovering around bear market territory. While the recent volatility in financial markets have also increased investor angst over global growth prospects.

Since the prior meeting, ECB source reports had hit newswires suggesting that few members had wanted guidance on growth to state that risks are tilted to the downside. If indeed, the doves on the committee get their way, this may weigh on the Euro against its counterparts.

While downside risks have appeared to have grown in recent weeks an upbeat assessment from President Draghi and a dismissal of the recent turbulence may curb any further selling the Euro with the ECB undeterred from altering its plan to end QE.

EURUSD to be Driven by Eurozone Economy as Well as US Elections	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/11/06/EURUSD-to-be-Driven-by-Eurozone-Economy-as-Well-as-US-Elections.html	1541502000	"
The EURUSD pair’s near-term movements will likely be driven by today’s US mid-term elections.
$$$$
However, signs of a more stable Eurozone economy are emerging too and that could influence the pair once the elections are over.
"	"
The near-term direction of the EURUSD price will likely be determined by the results of today’s US mid-term elections, as well as the US-China trade dispute and the re-imposition by the US of sanctions on Iran.
$$$$
However, traders in the pair should also keep an eye open for developments on the Euro side of the equation as signs emerge of a modest economic recovery although the EU row with Italy over its budget shows little sign of abating.
$$$$
Broadly speaking, a strong showing by US President Donald Trump’s Republican Party would likely boost the USD while gains for the Democrats would likely weaken it. However, the latest economic data from the Eurozone are mildly positive for EURUSD, which has risen from the 2018 low at 1.1301 touched on August 15.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
Data released by Germany early Tuesday showed industrial orders up by 0.3% month/month in September instead of falling by 0.5% as market analysts had expected. Moreover, final data for the Eurozone composite purchasing managers’ index in October showed a rise to 53.1, up from the 52.7 flash estimate.
$$$$
That is still the lowest figure since September 2016 and the ongoing dispute between the EU and Italy over the Italian budget led to another increase in Italian bond yields Tuesday. Moreover, Eurozone economic growth remains subdued, with momentum seemingly weakening.
$$$$
However, the data suggest that the climb in EURUSD from the 1.1302 low touched on October 31 could extend higher once the US election results are out of the way.

The impressive bounce off 1.1300 has seen EURUSD push back above 1.1420 - a fresh one-week high - and back towards a confluence of important chart points between 1.1461 and 1.1557. The upside may be limited in the short-term however by the latest look at the US labor market, with 193k jobs new jobs expected to have been added last month. Today’s average hourly earnings figure may be of more interest however, especially for inflation watchers, with a rise of 3.2% m/m in October expected, compared to 2.8% last month.
$$$$
The bounce off 1.1300, the August 15 low print, coincided with a bout of USD weakness, with the US Dollar basket (DXY) over 1 point lower in the last two days. Support for the greenback nears at 95.55 and 95.21. The uptrend remains in place for now but a break and close below the October low at 94.98 would threaten further upside.

Most Asia Pacific benchmark stocks traded higher heading into Thursday’s close amidst hopes that the US would propose new rounds of trade talks with China. Last week, these indexes suffered as the Trump Administration threatened additional Chinese tariffs on most of their exports and then turned his attention towards Japan. 
$$$$
The Nikkei 225, which was up about 0.88%, is now heading for its best weekly performance since July. China’s Shanghai Composite edged cautiously higher, though most of its gains were pared after gapping to the upside. South Korea’s KOSPI rose more than 0.2 percent. One notable outlier was the ASX 200 which was led about 0.60% lower by financials.
$$$$
Looking at currencies, the Australian Dollar appreciated against its major counterparts after a solid jobs report. However, lasting follow through for the Aussie based on RBA hawkish bets seems unlikely as the pro-risk currency focuses on developments pertaining to trade wars and emerging market contagion fears. The anti-risk Japanese Yen depreciated across the board. 
$$$$
Ahead, the markets are bracing for a slew of pertinent economic event risk. These are the ECB and BoE interest rate announcements. The former may have set itself up for a dovish announcement after reports crossed the wires yesterday that the ECB could lower their projections for economic growth. Meanwhile, the reaction in the British Pound on the Bank of England rate decision will depend on the margin of votes to keep rates unchanged. And then to top it all off, the US Dollar braces for August’s CPI report.

The head and shoulders bearish reversal pattern in EUR/USD appears to have failed to transpire amidst yesterday’s US Dollar weakness. The pair is now heading for its longest consecutive daily winning streak since August 29th. At the moment, prices remain just under a descending range of resistance from June. Simultaneously, they are supported by a rising channel from roughly the same time. Resumption of Euro weakness may see 1.1568 hold as support followed by 1.1531.

USD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
The rise in the USD index may be somewhat modest at best from these levels with CFTC data showing a reduction in USD long positioning over the past two weeks as speculators shed $2.5bln worth of longs. Alongside this, speculators on the Euro have recently flipped into net long, suggesting that the base may be set for EURUSD for now.
$$$$
With tightening by the Federal Reserve priced in by the markets, eyes are on a continued rise in inflation to potentially shift the Fed into a more aggressive stance. However, with yesterday’s PPI report underwhelming expectations and showing the first decline in 18-months, risks for today’s CPI print are tilted to the downside. As such, a dip in inflation could pressure the greenback as markets reign in expectations of a potentially more aggressive tightening path.
$$$$
The risks associated to trade wars remain at the forefront of investors’ minds. However, these risks have receded somewhat given recent reports that the US are to reach out to China for another round of talks, in order to reach an agreement and refrain from implementing further tariffs. Elsewhere, optimism surrounding NAFTA has been by Canada’s efforts to provide concessions on key stumbling blocks to pave the way for a deal. Trade wars have been a factor in the boost for the greenback in recent months and a reduction in trade war risks could see the USD on the backfoot.

EURUSD Nudges Lower After ECB Stands Pat: Press Conference Ahead	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/09/13/EURUSD-Nudges-Lower-After-ECB-Stands-Pat-Press-Conference-Ahead.html	1536841680	"

The latest ECB monetary policy announcement produced no surprises as the central bank left all settings unchanged. The ECB reiterated that asset purchases would halve to EUR15 billion in October from a current rate of EUR30 billion and that interest rates would be kept on hold ‘through the summer of 2019’. 
$$$$
EURUSD remained little changed post announcement and investors will now wait to see if President Draghi gives any clues about Q2 GDP growth – a slight downgrade is expected – or if there is a chance that asset purchases may continue next year.

EURUSD currently trades around 1.16150 and sits in the middle of the 20- and 50-day moving average cloud.
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment Datashow that retail investors are 44.8% net-long EURUSD but recent changes suggest the pair may soon move lower.

Brexit Latest Helps Pound but GBP/USD Downtrend Holds. JPY at Risk	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/09/10/Brexit-Latest-Helps-Pound-but-GBPUSD-Downtrend-Holds-JPY-at-Risk.html	1536620400	"
Brexit latest supports British Pound but the dominant downtrend in GBP/USD still holds
$$$$
Euro prices rallied too, but most support due to Swedish Election results. USD/CHF rose
$$$$
Asia Pacific shares may echo gains from S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite, Yen at risk
"	"
Trade all the major global economic data live and interactive at the DailyFX Webinars. We’d love to have you along.
$$$$
The British Pound soared against its major counterparts on Monday as supportive Brexit news crossed the wires. EU’s Chief Brexit Negotiator Michael Barnier said that getting a Brexit deal is ‘realistic’ in six to eight weeks. Accompanying GBP/USD’s ascent was a surge in front-end government bond yields, signaling rising BoE hawkish monetary policy bets ahead of this week’s interest rate announcement.
$$$$
Another notable benefactor of this update were Euro prices, which too soared. However, most of EUR/USD’s gain was capitalized as European markets came online after the Swedish Election. The DAX rose 0.22% and Euro Stoxx 50 by +0.48% after the Eurosceptic Sweden Democrats performed worse than expected compared to preliminary polls.
$$$$
As a result of the improvement in market mood, the anti-risk Swiss Franc notably underperformed but by even more so than its similarly-behaving Japanese counterpart the Yen. This may have been due to the Franc’s role at times as the favored European regional haven asset which gives it an edge over JPY when it comes to EU political uncertainty.
$$$$
The ‘risk on’ trading dynamic echoed into Wall Street where the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite rallied 0.19% and 0.27% respectively. This offered those global benchmark stock indexes a relief after consecutive days of losses. Meanwhile the pro-risk Australian Dollar headed cautiously higher. The US Dollar was rather mixed as the Euro and British Pound appreciated.
$$$$
With that in mind, after yesterday’s mixed session, Asia Pacific markets could take this opportunity to trade higher absent revived fears of trade wars. Such an outcome could bolster the Australian Dollar while dampening the Japanese Yen. The former could also show some temporary volatility on Australian business confidence. 
$$$$
British Pound prices may have made upside progress in recent days, but GBP/USD still remains contained by a descending range of resistance from May. A push above the channel with confirmation would pave the way for a reversal of its dominant downtrend since April. This places near-term resistance as the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at 1.3317.

Trade Wars, Fed Policy Bets Sink S&P 500. EUR/USD Eyes August Low	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/09/09/Trade-Wars-Fed-Policy-Bets-Sink-SP-500-EURUSD-Eyes-August-Low.html	1536534000	"

"	"
Find out what retail traders’ FX buy and sell decisions say about the coming price trend!
$$$$
The US Dollar appreciated versus its FX majors, boosted by a strong jobs report where wage growth accelerated to its fastest since May 2009. US government bond yields rose, signaling firming Fed rate hike expectations. A similarly impressive employment report back in January arguably led to a collapse in the S&P 500 during the first couple of weeks in February as markets anticipated tightening credit conditions.
$$$$
But the greenback’s appreciation was not done there. In the aftermath of critical event risk, Donald Trump announced that he is prepared to impose an additional $267b in Chinese tariffs on top of the already proposed $200b that could be implemented soon. Being the world’s reserve currency, the US Dollar then benefited from more gains as investors sought safety. As a result, the Euro depreciated against USD.
$$$$
This also led to risk aversion as the S&P 500 ended the day 0.22% lower and marked its fourth day of consecutive losses. This was also its worst week since June. The NASDAQ Composite experienced its longest daily losing streak since April 24th as it fell the most in a week since March. Emerging Markets entered bear territory as the MSCI EM ETF Index fell over 20% from its January peak.
$$$$
Pro-risk currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars suffered. But looking at AUD/NZD, we still remain long after its decline was comparatively smaller when looking at AUD/USD and NZD/USD given its tendency to behave as a ‘risk neutral’ pair. Pro-risk FX such as the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc struggled gaining as markets arguably favored the more liquid US Dollar.
$$$$
Meanwhile the similarity sentiment-sensitive Canadian Dollar fared slightly better than its Australian and New Zealand counterparts. This was despite a disappointing Canadian jobs report where unemployment unexpectedly rose while hourly earnings softened. Perhaps prospects of Canada being part of the new NAFTA deal potentially next week offered some respite. The TSX rose after gapping to the downside.
$$$$
Asia Pacific stocks could weaken on Monday, echoing trade war concerns that rattled Wall Street Friday. This could offer a chance for the Japanese Yen to pick up pace as it brushes off a GDP report. The Bank of Japan seems unlikely to alter its monetary policy course on the data. Meanwhile AUD/USD and NZD/USD could be left vulnerable to weakness. Do also note that Swedens went to the polls on Sunday and a result that shows the Eurosceptic Swedish Democrats gaining traction could sour market mood further.
$$$$
Euro prices closed at their lowest since August 24th against the US Dollar. EUR/USD has also formed a head and shoulders bearish reversal pattern after the pair was unable to push through a descending range of resistance from June. Confirmation of the pattern is still needed via a close under the neckline around 1.15312. This could open the door to a reversal to the August low at 1.1301.

EURUSD Bearish Bias Towards Crucial Support After Strong US Wages	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/09/10/EURUSD-Bearish-Bias-Towards-Crucial-Support-After-Strong-US-Wages.html	1536566700	"
EURUSD Eyes Key Supports Following Strong US Wage Growth
$$$$
Another Reduction in USD Longs Signal Potential Top
"	"
EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
The Euro remains under pressure this morning and looks to press for lower levels towards the psychological 1.15 support area. Friday’s NFP reading saw wage growth rising at its fastest pace since 2009 at 2.9%, consequently rate differentials continue to move in favour of USD buying vs. the Euro as markets begin to expect a faster pace of tightening from the Federal Reserve. As it stands, money markets have fully priced in a September rate rise, while December rate hike odds are at 70%. 
$$$$
Eyes are on the psychological 1.15 support area which could curb for losses in the pair with 2.1bln worth of option expiries potentially keeping the pair buoyed. Elsewhere, notable Fibonacci support sits at 1.1518 which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the 1.13-1.1733 rise, while CFTC data showing another reduction in USD longs, suggest that the US Dollar could potentially have topped out.

The ZEW indicator of German economic sentiment fell by 10.6 in September; better than both the -13.5 predicted by analysts and the -13.7 recorded in August. While EURUSD was largely unchanged on the data, the German DAX stock-market index is falling following the data release.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
The current conditions index came in at 76.0, up from 72.6 and above the 72.0 forecast, but ZEW said that during the survey period, currency crises in Turkey and Argentina intensified while German industrial production and incoming orders were surprisingly low.
$$$$
The ZEW index of economic sentiment is a leading indicator for the German economy but generally has less impact on the markets than the similar Ifo index. Nonetheless, it is one of the first indicators of the strength of the Eurozone economy each month so still has an effect. It is based on a survey of up to 300 analysts from banks, insurance companies and the financial departments of selected companies.
$$$$
Calculated by ZEW, the Center for European Economic Research in Germany, it has now been negative for six successive months.

EUR/USD On Edge of Reversing Dominant Downtrend, USD/JPY May Rise	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/09/13/EURUSD-On-Edge-of-Reversing-Dominant-Downtrend-USDJPY-May-Rise.html	1536879600	"

$$$$
EUR/USD on edge of reversing dominant downtrend, Yen may fall as Asian shares gain
"	"
Find out what the #1 mistake that traders make is and how you can fix it! 
$$$$
EUR/USD prices soared after worse-than-expected US CPI data temporarily lower Fed rate hike expectations. However, the US Dollar recovered in the immediate aftermath as local government bond yields pared losses. This insinuates that the outlook for Fed interest rates were essentially left unchanged by the end of the day. 
$$$$
The Euro did hold on to gains though and this may have been due to commentary from ECB’s President Mario Draghi. While he noted that protectionism and emerging market risks have gained prominence, he then added that Turkish and Argentinian spillovers have not been substantial. This may have cooled some worries about contagion back when the central bank noted concern about EU bank exposure to Turkey.
$$$$
Anti-risk Japanese Yen prices suffered the most on Thursday, weakening alongside gains in stocks in APAC trade which then picked up after Wall Street open. The S&P 500 is now on its longest daily consecutive winning streak since August 29th at four days. Most gains were due to a gap, there was a pullback after Donald Trump tweeted that they aren’t under pressure to make a deal with China.
$$$$
The MSCI Emerging Markets ETF also gapped to the upside and ended the day 1.31% higher after the Turkish central bank raised interest rates to 24% which helped the Lira appreciate. USD/TRY is now at its lowest since August 27th. The turnaround in the US Dollar also left the alternatively high-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand Dollars mostly little changed.
$$$$
NZD/USD headed cautiously higher in early Friday trade after New Zealand Manufacturing PMI beat estimates. But gains may not last given that the RBNZ is not actively looking to raise interest rates in the near-term. With that in mind, the focus for markets will arguably be risk trends. USD/JPY may continue rising if Asia Pacific equities echo gains from Wall Street.
$$$$
This may also bode well for the Australian Dollar, but it also faces Chinese industrial production and retail sales. The Aussie is seen as a liquid China market proxy due to Australia’s key trading relationship with it. Signs that Chinese manufacturing is losing momentum amidst the US tariffs and trade wars could send AUD/USD lower.
$$$$
Gains in Euro prices have led EUR/USD at the edge of a range of descending resistance dating back to June. With that in mind, a lasting reversal of the dominant downtrend since April would need confirmation. That could be confirmed by achieving more closes above resistance, especially if 1.17447 is breached next. Getting above that would then expose 1.17908.

Asian Stocks Mostly Rise, Trade Worries Still Cap Enthusiasm	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/09/14/Asian-Stocks-Friday.html	1536901260	"

$$$$
Asian stocks were mostly higher on Friday but trade concerns are still keeping optimism in check.
$$$$
The region’s important semiconductor session was also stronger, having lost ground this week on a gloomy outlook from Goldman Sachs. However there’s no getting far away from the simmering trade tensions between China and the US. Donald Trump said on Thursday that the pressure was on China to make a trade deal with the US rather than vice versa. His remarks followed reports that the US wanted to restart talks with Beijing.
$$$$
Still, the Nikkei 225 was up 0.8% as its weekly close approached. All other major bourses were in the green too, to varying degrees, with the exception of the Shanghai Composite. It was down but only by 0.1%.
$$$$
In the foreign-exchange market, the US Dollar failed to regain much of the shine lost after Thursday’s weaker-than-expected inflation numbers. A Turkish rate hike soothed some of the recent jitters over Emerging Market currencies whereas the prospect of reduced stimulus in the Eurozone supported the Euro.
$$$$
EUR/USD seems to be attempting to break out of its current uptrend channel, having returned to peaks not seen since August, 2017.
$$$$
The Australian Dollar has had quite a strong weak by its own standards this year, although it remains under strategic pressure against its US big brother. Domestic growth and employment numbers have both surprised to the upside in the past five days, but a solid set of Chinese data on Friday didn’t see it gain much more. 
$$$$
Gold prices stayed up as those weak US inflation numbers put a little shadow over rate-hike prognoses. Crude oil prices also managed gains but trade related demand worries still cap the market.
$$$$
Still to come on Friday’s economic schedule, official US retail sales figures and the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment snapshot. Central bank watchers can look forward to comment from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans and Boston’s Eric Rosengren.

Asia Pacific benchmark stock indexes traded rather mixed despite US President Donald Trump announcing $200b in Chinese tariffs due to take effect starting on September 24th. Looking at currencies also revealed a ‘risk on’ trading dynamic. What seemed to be keeping the mood somewhat upbeat were pronounced gains in Japanese equities.
$$$$
The Nikkei 225, after being closed on Monday for a holiday, rallied more than 1.55 percent heading into Tuesday’s close. Almost all sectors led it higher with strong gains in particular from autos and consumer staples. On the daily chart, the Nikkei 225 gapped to the upside and was on its way to close at its highest since January.
$$$$
Declines were seen in Chinese and Australian equities. The Shanghai Composite edged cautiously lower (-0.12%) while the ASX 200 dived about 0.40%. The anti-risk Japanese yen depreciated across the board while the higher-yielding Australian and New Zealand Dollars appreciated.
$$$$
During Tuesday APAC trade, China’s Commerce Minister noted that cooperation is the ‘only right’ choice for the nation. This may have reduced expectations that the targeted nation would dial back retaliation threats, perhaps offering the markets some respite. Though Japanese shares had at that point already clocked in most of their gains. 
$$$$
Ahead, the Euro awaits a speech from ECB’s Governor Mario Draghi. But his tone may not deviate far off from a rather unsurprising monetary policy announcement last week. Rather, EUR/USD and sentiment may be adversely impacted by how emerging markets handle the US tariff updates. The MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is heading back down to the September lows, more declines could bolster the haven-linked US Dollar and send AUD/USD lower.
$$$$
See our study on the history of trade wars to learn how it might influence financial markets!
$$$$
The Nikkei 225’s push higher has exposed the 78.6% Fibonacci extension at 23,587 which could be its next target after a close above the May high. Meanwhile, near-term support is the descending resistance line from May which is just above the 50% level at 22,814.

US-China trade relations continue to erode after the latest round of US trade tariffs came into force Monday on USD200 billion of Chinese goods with China set to retaliate by imposing tariffs on USD60 billion of US imports. This in turn will spark an additional USD267 billion of US tariffs on Chinese goods.

EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
Yesterday saw the Euro register its largest gain against the greenback since late June with the USD continuing to remain weak and back to range lows despite the rise in Treasury yields. The rise in the Euro had also been exacerbated by the technical breakout above resistance at 1.1720 before taking out the July 9th high at 1.1790 to touch 1.18 for the first time since June. On the upside, provided that there is a close above 1.1790-1.18, the next significant target would be 1.1850, which marks the ECB taper day high.
$$$$
Flash PMI readings for France had disappointed slightly with both Manufacturing and Services figures missing analyst expectations. Consequently, this has taken the shine of the rise in the Euro, while the German PMI report provided a mixed outlook with the miss in manufacturing offset by the firmer services figure. Similarly, with the German release, the Eurozone PMI also provided a mixed report with the services figure beating expectations, while manufacturing underwhelmed expectations.

USDJPY is rising but EURUSD is too ahead of an almost certain increase in US interest rates Wednesday by the Federal Open Markey Committee. That suggests the increase is now fully priced in to the markets and that the future direction of USD will depend near-term on what the FOMC says about the chances of another hike on December 19.
$$$$
According to the CME FedWatch tool, the probability that the Federal Reserve will increase rates by a quarter of a percentage point tomorrow is 93.8% so the focus will be on the December meeting, where the chances of another rise are currently 76.2%. Any comments suggesting that is too high would weaken USD.
$$$$
Source: CME
$$$$
Looking at USDJPY first, the chart below shows the pair in a clear uptrend, with the price currently at its highest since July 19. That is in spite of comments Tuesday by Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda that the central bank has entered a phase where it must consider not just the merits but the side-effects of its huge stimulus program in a “balanced manner”.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
If the Fed takes a hawkish stance, USDJPY could reach that July 19 high at 113.18 or even trendline resistance at 113.52. However, if its statement is dovish, it could fall to the 20-day moving average at 111.82.
$$$$
By contrast, USD is weakening against EUR, with EURUSD hitting its highest Tuesday since June 14, helped by comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi forecasting a “relatively vigorous” pickup in underlying Eurozone inflation.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
That June 14 high at 118.52 is now the obvious target to the upside, with trendline support at 116.58 likely to limit the downside.
$$$$
Interest rates aside, the course of USD will also depend on developments is the US-China trade war, US President Donald Trump’s second talk at the United Nations General Assembly today and his meeting Thursday with US deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein amid doubts over Rosenstein’s future in the job.
$$$$
With USD now the go-to safe haven, any adverse news would likely prompt USD strength.

An increase in US interest rates by the Federal Reserve is almost certain later Wednesday, with the CME FedWatch tool suggesting a probability of 95% that the Federal Open Market Committee will raise its target rate by a quarter of a percentage point.
$$$$
However, there is a possibility that USD will drop in response to the decision on a typical ‘buy the rumor, sell the fact’ trade. Even a hint that US rates will be hiked again in December might fail to boost the currency as the probability of a further hike is already calculated to be almost 79%.

Note that US-China trade war fears seem to be easing after China’s response to the latest US tariffs was less aggressive than it might have been, while the US 10-year Treasury note yield has dipped early Wednesday in Europe to 3.085%.

EURUSD Battles Negative Italian Budget Sentiment, Weak CPI	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/09/28/EURUSD-Battles-Negative-Italian-Budget-Sentiment-Weak-CPI.html	1538126400	"
Italian government bond yields soar, as investors demand more yield for Italian risk.
$$$$
Core Euro-Zone inflation misses expectations and falls further.
"	"
The DailyFX Q3 EURand USD Forecasts are available to download. 
$$$$
Italian government bond yields are jumping higher again – yields rise as prices fall – after the government announced a budget deficit target of 2.4% for the next three years, sharply higher than Finance Minister Tria’s option of 1.6%. While this is a preliminary draft, and likely to be rejected by the European Commission in October, the scene is set for further discussions over whether Italy will break its debt targets and if ratings agencies will downgrade the country, an action that would force borrowing costs ever higher. Italian 10-year government bonds currently yield 3.15% and are closing in on the recent four-and-a-half year high of 3.25%.
$$$$
The latest Euro-Zone inflation release will also add to the downward move in EURUSD with the core reading falling to 0.9% from a prior month’s 1.1% and missing expectations of a 1.1% print. The headline figure confirmed expectations of 2.1%.
$$$$
The daily chart shows EURUSD now trending below the 20-day moving average and nearing the 50-day average at 1.15940. Below here the double-dip low at 1.1508 provides support ahead of 1.1448 and the recent 14-month low at 1.1300.
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment Datashow that retail investors are 41.4% net-long EURUSD – a bullish contrarian signal – but recent positional changes suggest that prices may soon trend lower.

US Dollar Drives Higher as Fed's Favorite Inflation Gauge Hits Target	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/09/28/US-Dollar-Drives-Higher-as-Feds-Favorite-Inflation-Gauge-Hits-Target.html	1538147160	"
PCE Core for August was released at 2%, matching last month’s reading and forecasts
$$$$
Personal income read in slightly below target
$$$$
Dollar strength derived from Euro weakness continued with the data release
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
The Fed’s favorite inflation measure came in on target Friday, just two days after the central bank hiked interest rates. Personal consumption expenditure core read 2%, landing on target for expectations and last month’s reading. PCE deflator also hit the forecasted 2.2% and has been shown to be a more comprehensive and consistent gauge of inflation in the United States. Another important metric, personal income, was released in conjunction with PCE Friday.   
$$$$
According to estimates by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal income increased by $60.3 billion in August. The increase translates to a gain of 0.3%, which fell short of the 0.4% forecast. Conversely, personal spending reached the forecasted 0.3% but slipped from last month’s 0.4%. The consistency of the data should assure the Fed of their path moving forward and offered some strength to the Dollar in early trading hours.
$$$$
The Dollar basket started off strong Friday, driving higher on the back of positive data and Euro weakness. Following budget statements from the Italian government, Euro risk aversion rose and resulted in a sell-off of the currency. Consequently, the Dollar basket is poised for a third consecutive day of gains after the Fed’s decision.     
$$$$
US Dollar Basket Price Chart, 1-Hour September 24th – 28th
$$$$
At the time of this article’s release, the Dollar basket boasted a 0.22% gain for the day that it should hold onto barring any breaking news and the calm economic calendar. Next week however, trade talks and US employment figures could disrupt the Dollar’s strength seen this week.

The Euro got an unusual boost in Asia Pacific trading hours Wednesday on reports that Italy plans to cut its budget deficit.
$$$$
Worries about increased spending from the country’s new euroskeptic government have weighed on the currency in the past few weeks, and seen Italian bond yields head sharply higher.
$$$$
Some political leaders have even suggested, once again, that leaving the Euro would solve a lot of Italy’s financial problems However, a piece in the Corriere della Sera daily citing a Cabinet meeting said that a draft plan proposes cutting the deficit to 2% of Gross Domestic Product in 2021. The government forecasts a deficit of 2.4% in 2019 and 2.2% in 2020.
$$$$
The deficit reductions were prioritized under pressure from the European Union, the report says, with spending cuts to come, so Italian political reaction in the next few days may well be worth watching for Euro investors. It's not clear that many will  feel that EU-mandated austerity was what they voted for in the March general election. However, for now the markets are seeing the report as positive for the single currency.
$$$$
On its broader, daily chat, EUR/USD remains very much on the defensive, and it makes a lot of sense that this should be so. The US Federal Reserve is much further along the road of post-crisis monetary-policy normalization than the European Central Bank, the latter having to juggle the apparently divergent interest rate needs of disparate EU economies.
$$$$
Indeed EUR/USD still looks close to a downside range break for all its Wednesday vigor. If seen, focus will then be on mid-August’s lows around 1.1315

EURUSD Remains Technically Weak Despite Italian Budget Chatter	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/10/03/EURUSD-Remains-Technically-Weak-Despite-Italian-Budget-Chatter.html	1538553600	"

Italian government bond yields nudge lower.
"	"
We have just released our Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
EURUSD has bounced back off yesterday’s 1.15050 low and is heading back towards 1.1600 on a newspaper report that the Italian government plans to reduce its budget deficit to 2% in 2021 after announcing last week that the deficit would be 2.4% for the next three years. This caused concern higher up in the EU who warned Italy to trim its deficit targets. Italian bond yields soared to multi-year highs yesterday on the news as investors fled Italian assets.
$$$$
Italian government bond yields are lower today on the news, but the move is far from convincing. 10-year bonds yield 3.32%, down from a multi-year high print of 3.46%, while the 10-year Italy/German spread has narrowed back to around 290 basis points from 300+ on Tuesday. 10-year Italian bonds traded with a yield around 2.70% three weeks ago.
$$$$
On the daily chart, EURUSD continues to find resistance from the 50-day moving average at 1.15947, followed by the 20-day ma at 1.16640. Above here the Fibonacci resistance (38.2%) comes into play at 1.1710. On the downside, support remains at 1.15081 for the time being, although a break and close below would open up 1.14480 (50% Fib) ahead of 1.1301.

Stocks, FX Risk Averse Despite Italy News. NZD/USD Decline Done?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/10/03/Stocks-FX-Risk-Averse-Despite-Italy-News-NZDUSD-Decline-Done.html	1538544600	"
Uplifting Italian budget news fails to soothe markets, Nikkei 225 declines with market mood
$$$$
Illiquidity, HKMA peg defend worries, Indian Rupee weakness contribute to AUD losses
$$$$
Euro rose as NZD/USD faces its next barrier in order to resume the dominant downtrend
"	"
Find out what retail traders’ equities buy and sell decisions say about the coming price trend!
$$$$
The Euro awakened during Wednesday’s Asia Pacific trading session via a welcoming update on Italy’s budget report. Reports crossed the wires that the country is preparing a plan that proposes reducing the deficit to 2% of GDP in 2021. EUR/USD climbed over 0.2% on the announcement which sets up the Euro to end its longest consecutive losing streak on a daily basis in almost two months (5 days).
$$$$
This offered a temporary relief to some APAC benchmark stock indexes such as the Nikkei 225 which rose on the update. But that failed to meaningfully reverse the somewhat pessimistic mood in the markets. Heading into the latest Italian budget update, the Nikkei 225 was already declining which was taking the pro-risk Australian and New Zealand Dollars lower with it.
$$$$
As Wednesday’s trading session began, the Hong Kong Dollar depreciated about 0.07% against its US counterpart bringing USD/HKD closer to the upper limit of the HKMA’s peg. In fact, the pair has been heading to that area for over a week at this point amidst broad gains in the US Dollar. This may have rekindled concerns about the HKMA defending its currency which has stoked risk aversion in the past.
$$$$
Not to mention Asian shares might have also been echoing the relatively lackluster performance on Wall Street where the NASDAQ Composite declined about 0.47%. Adding to this is that Chinese and South Korean stock markets were closed for holidays, reducing liquidity to a certain extent which can often exacerbate FX volatility.
$$$$
Meanwhile the Indian Rupee depreciated around 0.6% as USD/INR rose to a record 73.41. India, and other emerging markets, have been under pressure lately amidst tightening global credit conditions. The recent increase in crude oil prices to their highest since 2014 also does not help in curbing their current account deficit. Developing nations may continue being under pressure which bodes ill for sentiment and currencies such as AUD and NZD.
$$$$
The New Zealand Dollar approaches its next obstacle in its efforts to resume the dominant downtrend from June. NZD/USD prices face the February 2016 lows between 0.65454 and 0.65633. A descent through support will open the door to test the September low at 0.65011. Meanwhile a key resistance barrier now seems to be a range between 0.66992 and 0.67213 on the chart below.

S&P 500 Presses Record Levels After Stunning Service Sector Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/10/03/SP-500-Presses-Record-Levels-After-Stunning-Service-Sector-Data.html	1538580600	"
ISM non-manufacturing read in at 61.6 versus the forecasted 58 and last month’s 58.5
$$$$
The data contradicts the slight miss in ISM manufacturing data released Monday
$$$$
Services data coupled with strong employment figures sent the S&P 500 and Dow higher
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
September’s Institute for Supply Management non-manufacturing index crossed the wires Wednesday and surpassed all expectations. The data revealed the service industry expanded at the quickest pace on record, as the composite reached the highest level since the survey’s inception. The overall index read 61.6, above the forecasted 58 and last month’s 58.5. September’s data marked the 110th consecutive month of growth in the service sector industry. 
$$$$
A more detailed look at the index revealed the index’s increase was not isolated to a specific area but came from broad sector strength. Business activity offered a robust 4.5% increase from August, climbing to 65.2. Similarly, both the new orders and prices index climbed over 1%, resulting in 61.6 and 62.8 readings respectively. The employment section offered a drastic 5.7% bump from August, falling in-line with Wednesday’s ADP data surprise. The ADP report recorded 230,000 private sector payrolls were added last month versus the forecasted 185,000. 
$$$$
Fourth Quarter Forecasts for currencies, commodities, and equities are out!
$$$$
Although the report was overwhelmingly positive, there were some areas highlighted for concern. Capacity, logistics, and trade were among them but were not enough to halt robust gains in other areas. “The non-manufacturing sector has had two consecutive months of strong growth since the 'cooling off' in July. Overall, respondents remain positive about business conditions and the current and future economy,"" said ISM Chair Anthony Nieves. However, ""concerns remain about capacity, logistics and the uncertainty with global trade,” he concluded. 
$$$$
As the service industry comprises roughly 75% of United States GDP, market response to the data was notable. Coupled with the strong employment data from ADP, the non-manufacturing index pushed the S&P 500 to near record levels. Similarly the Dow pressed to new heights, marking yet another day when the industrial average notched a new record. 
$$$$
See how our clients are positioned on different assets and currency pairs with IG Client Sentiment.
$$$$
At the time of this article’s release, the S&P 500 retraced some of the gains initially posted due to the data. Still, service industry figures will weigh on investor and consumer confidence as the fourth quarter progresses. 
$$$$
For the Dow, the data release bolstered the initially bearish index which regained ground and pressed higher. Since then, the direct impact of the release has waned and traders now look to the next important events on the economic calendar to influence their trading.

US dollar powers ahead on hawkish Fed talk.
$$$$
Euro under fundamental and technical pressure.
"	"
We have just released our Brand New Q4 Trading Forecasts including USD and EUR.
$$$$
EURUSD continues to move lower on a combination of a resurgent US dollar – fueled by hawkish Fed talk – and a weak fundamental and technical Euro backdrop. And as the pair move lower, support levels are likely to creak under selling pressure. Italian government bond yields refuse to move lower with the closely watched 10-year currently trading with a yield of 3.35%, just 10 basis points below its recent multi-year high. The recently announced Italian budget will continue to worry the market, and depress the Euro, before Brussels gives its view on the proposal later in the month. 
$$$$
The daily EURUSD chart shows the pair falling back down to 50% Fibonacci support at 1.14480 before this year’s low, made on August 16, at 1.1301 comes into play with seemingly little between those levels to stem the fall. If selling accelerates, the important 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.11870 becomes a longer-term target. The pair also trade below all three moving averages, a negative set-up, while retail sentiment is also negative.

Positive Brexit talk should be watched but taken with a pinch of salt.
$$$$
EURGBP technical set-up remains bearish in the short- to medium-term.
"	"
The DailyFX Q4EUR and GBP Forecasts are available to download. 
$$$$
A combination of a weak EUR and renewed GBP strength has driven EURGBP back down to multi-month lows with the likelihood of even lower prices ahead. The Euro has suffered this week on Italian budget fears and neutral to mildly negative data, with weak German services/composite PMI readings on Wednesday the standout. Italian government bond yields remain within 10-12 basis points of a new multi-year high as investors fret that Italy’s huge debt pile will weigh on the government’s budget spending plans. If yields continue to rise, the cost of servicing this debt may well prompt rating’s agencies to downgrade the country’s outlook, causing funding costs to rise further.
$$$$
Sterling is starting to perk up on chatter that a Brexit deal is becoming more likely after EU President Donald Tusk re-iterated that a Canada+++ deal is still on the table. While GBP positive, it should be remembered that Sterling strengthened going into the recent Salzburg meeting, only to fade back after the EU demanded more from the UK.  
$$$$
The technical outlook for EURGBP has turned bearish with the pair having broken through the 200-day moving average, a negative sign. The six-week downtrend is also intact with little in the way of support before 0.8700. Below here the April low of 0.86207 comes into play and this looks likely to tested if positive Brexit rumors and talk are confirmed over the next two weeks.
$$$$
IG Client Sentiment Datashows that retail are 47.2% net-long EURGBP, a mildly bullish contrarian set-up. However recent shifts in daily and weekly sentiment give us a mixed/neutral EURGBP outlook.

EURUSD remains in a holding pattern ahead of the latest US labor and earnings report with market expectations looking for a stronger release to support the US dollar at its current level. Recent US data has been strong, especially the ADP report and the ISM non-manufacturing/services composite release, and any upside beat in either the jobs or wages component today will hit an already weak EURUSD.
$$$$
Alternatively, a weaker-than-expected report will give the pair a small boost, but the underlying fundamental and technical outlook for EURUSD remains firmly pointed to the downside in the short-to-medium term.
$$$$
A look at government bond spreads between the two show the 2-year US Treasury now offering over 330 basis points more than comparable German debt, while in the10-year space, the US offers around 265 basis points of extra yield. The widening of this yield differential will continue to draw flows towards the US dollar.
$$$$
The daily chart shows support at 1.1509 broken – the late May/early June double touch – and the pair trading under all three moving averages. Fibonacci support at 1.1448 will offer some support ahead of the August 15 low at 1.1301. The downtrend from the September 24 high at 1.18154 remains in place.

A combination of ongoing Italian budget concerns and a US dollar invigorated by a last-minute NAFTA deal may push EURUSD back to the low seen on August 15 at 1.1300. with support levels looking shaky.

Italian budget concerns continue to rumble on, putting pressure on the country’s debt pile. 10-year yields are looking to make new multi-year highs (yields go up when prices go down) with the EU Commission looking likely to reject the budget in November, leaving Italy at the mercy of an unforgiving bond market. 10-year Italian bond yields are currently just over 3.20%, around 270 basis points more than comparable German debt (0.48%) and 168 basis points more than 10-year Spanish bonds (1.52%).

$$$$
The US trade deficit shrunk slightly in August, and July’s figure was revised lower
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
One of the more important data pieces used in gauging the health of the domestic economy crossed the wires Friday, but missed expectations. US non-farm payrolls for September read in at 134k versus 180k and August’s 270k. Economists had projected a strong figure following last month’s and positive ADP data coupled with the effects from Hurricane Harvey but those impacts did not materialize. Still, unemployment dropped to its lowest since 1969 at 3.7%. 
$$$$
The payroll miss was contrasted by a surprise uptick in the corresponding Canadian figure. Employers in Canada added 63.3k jobs in September, beating out the forecasted 25k. However, Canadian unemployment remained stagnant at 5.9%. The data releases sent USD higher versus its Canadian counterpart, suggesting other influencers were at play.   
$$$$
USD/CAD Hourly Price Chart, October 
$$$$
One such influencer was the US trade balance. August data revealed the trade deficit fell below expectations by $400 million, reading in at -$53.2 billion. While still a robust deficit, a reading below expectations while the nation is engulfed in a trade war is undoubtedly positive.
$$$$
Read up on the history of economic conflicts with A Brief History of Trade Wars.
$$$$
Similarly, last month’s trade deficit was revised lower to -$50 billion. The trade data will likely draw the attention of President Trump as he looks to press trade negotiations with other nations like Japan. While the data may have been sufficient to drive USD/CAD higher, the US Dollar index fell following the releases.

The closely watched Italy-German 10-year yield spread touched 300 basis points in early trade, the widest in over five years, while further down the curve the Italy-German 2-year yield spread is now over 200 basis points. And to highlight the weakness in the Italy bond market, 10-year Greek bonds offer just 75 basis points more than Italy. 
$$$$
Italian bond yields have soared lately as markets worry that the recent Italian budget will be turned down by the EU – European Commission President Juncker has already warned that allowing the Italian budget would destroy the EU – while higher government borrowing costs (via higher bond yields) prompt fears of debt sustainability. And to add fuel to the fire, Claudio Borghi, economic head of the League party, has been quoted as saying that Italy ‘could solve most of its problems if it had its own currency’.
$$$$
EURUSD continues to fall against this backdrop in the EU while the US dollar also continues to push higher, fueling the move. Just over one week ago EURUSD traded as high as 1.18154 compared to its current quote of 1.1530. The daily chart continues to look negative with the recent double touch low at 1.1508 under pressure which would open an eventual move all the way back down to 1.13010.

Worries about the Italian budget are still weakening the EURUSD price, which has now fallen for six sessions running and could decline further although a correction is possible first.
$$$$
Last week, Italy’s populist government announced it would widen its budget deficit target for next year to 2.4% of GDP, putting it potentially at odds with the EU and prompting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to say that “after the toughest management of the Greece crisis, we have to do everything to avoid a new Greece – this time an Italy – crisis.”
$$$$
In addition, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Pierre Moscovici, has warned that Italy should obey EU rules ahead of an October 15 deadline for Italy to submit its 2019 budget for approval to the Commission.
$$$$
The Euro, Italian shares and Italian government bond (BTP) prices have all dropped on the row, with the FTSE MIB index of Italian stocks falling steeply and the yield on the benchmark 10-year BTP rising to 3.385%, its highest since March 2014.
$$$$

$$$$
US President Donald Trump has offered assistance to Italy by buying Italian government bonds next year but Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio has accused EU officials of deliberately upsetting the markets by making adverse comments on the Italian budget, saying that “some European institutions are playing… at creating terrorism on the markets”.
$$$$
He has also said that if any of the rating agencies were to downgrade Italian debt over the budget plans “it would mean there is a prejudice against this government”.
$$$$On Tuesday, di Maio added that the government would not back down from its 2.4% target while Eurosceptic lawmaker Claudio Borghi said the country's economic situation would be easier if it were outside the Eurozone. $$$$
Meanwhile, the downward pressure on the Euro has been exacerbated by data showing the slowest growth in the Eurozone manufacturing sector for two years. The final purchasing managers’ index for the sector, released Monday, showed the PMI at 53.2 in September, down from both the “flash” estimate of 53.3 and the previous month’s 54.6.

EURUSD Remains Under Selling Pressure as Italian Bond Yields Jump	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/10/08/EURUSD-Remains-Under-Selling-Pressure-as-Italian-Bond-Yields-Jump.html	1538985600	"

$$$$
The Euro remains under pressure at the start of the week with Italian government bond yield rising further, dragging the 10-year BTP/Bund spread out to nearly 300 basis points, pointing to a weaker euro. The latest move higher in Italian yields reflects increasing concerns from the EU Commission that Italy’s budget is a ‘source of concern’ prompting fears of a showdown between the two. Italian 10-year yields have doubled since early May and are likely to test 4.00% in the short-term.
$$$$
Friday’s non-farm payrolls report was a mixed bag with a lower headline jobs report print but a strong upward revision in the prior month and a near five-decade low in the unemployment rate. The US dollar basket (DXY) remains in good technical shape – comfortably above all three moving averages – and is looking to re-test the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 95.87 which would leave 96.60 – a 16-month high – as the next target.
$$$$
EURUSD continues to trade either side of 1.1500 with support seen at 1.1464 ahead of 50% Fibonacci retracement at 1.14480. If broken and closed below, then 1.1300 comes into play.

Generally speaking, Asia Pacific stock markets traded somewhat mixed on Tuesday. After experiencing its worst performance in more than 3 months, the Shanghai Composite corrected about 0.50% higher on its second day back from a holiday. The mood outside of the world’s second largest economy fared worse however.
$$$$
The Nikkei 225 gapped lower for a second day as it fell about 1.21%, heading for its longest losing streak in a month (4-days). Australia’s ASX 200 fared hardly better, declining over one percent. Tensions between the US and China still remain elevated, as was noted yesterday by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was also pressured not to label China a currency manipulator.
$$$$
Interestingly, stocks and FX brushed off the International Monetary Fundcutting its global growth forecast, placing the focus on how developing nation markets will handle the news later. Should the MSCI Emerging Markets ETF accelerate its pronounced selloff since essentially earlier this year, we may see sentiment deteriorate which could pressure the anti-risk Australian and New Zealand Dollars lower.
$$$$
The US Dollar corrected cautiously lower despite a surge in local 10-year government bond yields, which resumed trading following the Christopher Columbus holiday. USD/HKD on the other hand rose over 0.7% as the 10-year yield rallied. USD/JPY headed for another day lower, accelerating a decline that could eventually lead prices towards a rising support line from March 2016.
$$$$
After setting new 2018 lows, the Australian Dollar is making corrective gains against its US counterpart and prices are poised to close above September low of 0.70852. Should emerging markets falter later today as outlined above, we may see AUD/USD resume its long-term descent as it eyes 2016 lows. Should the pair hold on to its upside progress, near-term resistance would be exposed around 0.71452.

EURUSD continues to probe the downside as Italian government bond yields creep higher – the 10-yr now yields 3.60% - and the US dollar continues to gain strength. This situation has been played out over the last couple of weeks but EURUSD price action is now closing in on an important support level, which if broken could lead to a further, sharp, fall.
$$$$
Euro negatives remain a weak Italian government bond market, fueled by ongoing budget concerns, a strong US dollar complex, driven by tighter US monetary policy and recent hawkish chatter from Federal Reserve speakers suggesting the US economy may be stronger, for longer.

A look at the daily price chart shows the pair currently trading a fraction above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the January 2017 – February 2018 rally at 1.14480, a level neared four times in the last week.

The latest look at the state of the US jobs market –Non-Farm Payrolls at 12:30 GMT–should provide yet more evidence that the US economy remains in robust shape, justifying more interest rate hikes ahead. Consensus is for another 195,000 jobs to have been created, below the 214,000-monthly average, but still enough to push the unemployment rate down to 3.8%, an 18-year low that was touched in May. 
$$$$
The US dollar basket (DXY) has edged lower in the last four days but remains well supported around 94.00 and should push higher over the coming days. DXY needs to break through the 95.20 - 95.30 zone before it can re-test the August 15 high at 96.60.
$$$$
The EURUSD rally off the August 15 low at 1.13010 has petered out and the pair continues to struggle to push higher. Short-term support is being provided by the 20- and 50-day moving averages at 1.15875 and 1.15987 respectively with an old swing-low form November at 1.15540 also adding a layer of support. Moves to the upside should find resistance at 1.16560 before a confluence of highs and Fibonacci retracement between 1.17100 and 1.17500.

Euro Gaps Lower After Lira Tumbles and Dollar Rallies, Eyes GDP	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/08/12/Euro-Gaps-Lower-After-Lira-Tumbles-and-Dollar-Rallies-Eyes-GDP.html	1534113000	"

The Euro opened this week’s trading session gapping lower against its US counterpart, responding to the Turkish Lira’s sharp downturn last week. The European Central Bank announced on Friday that it was concerned about the Lira’s exposure to European banks, fearing that financial contagion may spread to major lenders such as Unicredit, BBVA, and BNP Paribas. The currency pair closed on Friday at 1.1411 and opened today at 1.1373.

Similar to EUR/USD, global stocks also succumbed to losses as risk sentiment declined. The Euro Stoxx 50 ended Friday’s trading session at 3430.49, its lowest close since July 12th. The S&P 500 also gapped lower and the Nikkei 225 is set to open the Asia Pacific trading session -1.33% down. In the wake of souring market mood, the US Dollar rallied, as it is often looked to as a safe haven currency due to its highly liquid nature and status as the world’s reserve asset. However, the greenback’s ascent only further accelerated the Euro’s downside momentum. 
$$$$
The unit may reverse its previous falls in the wake of upcoming news and banking regulations imposed by Turkish authorities. Turkish bank regulator BDDK imposed limits on swap transactions, helping the Lira pare some of its losses from its record low and possibly offering relief for European financial institutions. Looking ahead, the Euro faces the release of preliminary 2Q Euro-Zone GDP later this week which is forecasted to hold steady at 2.1%.

The Euro has received a boost from comments by President Dollar Trump perceived as an attack on the Federal Reserve for raising US interest rates. His rhetoric has lifted the Euro and other currencies against the US Dollar, and the consequent rally in EURUSD may well continue near-term.

Speaking to the Reuters newsagency, Trump said “I'm not thrilled with his raising of interest rates, no. I’m not thrilled,” referring to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who was nominated by Trump last year to replace former Fed Chair Janet Yellen.

Chart by IG
$$$$
As the chart above shows, EURUSD has already rallied from a low of 1.1301 on August 15 to its current levels above 1.15 and that bounce could well continue to 1.1612, where the 50-day moving average sits. If that is broken, an extension to 1.1697 is feasible, the point at which both the 100-day moving average and trendline resistance check in. Beyond that, the July 9 high at 1.1791 would come into focus.
$$$$
Concerns that low level talks on US-China trade this week will not result in a breakthrough could give the US Dollar a lift but support at the 1.1301 August 15 low should prove strong if EURUSD turns down.

Asian Stocks Wilt As Turkey Fears Drive, Euro Eyed Nervously	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/08/13/Asian-Stocks-Wilt-As-Turkey-Fears-Drive-Euro-Eyed-Nervously.html	1534136400	"
Asia Pacific stock markets were all lower Monday
$$$$
Turkey’s woes saw risk appetite shrivel
$$$$
The Euro attracted nervous glances from those fearing contagion
"	"
The DailyFX Third-Quarter Fundamental and Technical Forecasts are out now
$$$$
Asian stocks were weaker across the board Monday as investor worries about Turkey cast a cloud over world markets.
$$$$
The battered Lira was clobbered anew last Friday when US President Donald Trump said he had approved the doubling of metals tariffs against Turkey. That country’s worries have investors casting nervous eyes on emerging-market US Dollar debt generally as US interest rates rise, taking the international cost of Dollars with them.
$$$$
That said contagion risk is, perhaps seen as slightly less of a worry for Asia, not that that has helped local equity as a new week kicks off. The Nikkei 225 was down 1.8% in the middle of the Tokyo afternoon, with the ASX 200 off by 0.5%. The Hang Seng fell 1.8% and Shanghai was down by 1.7%.
$$$$
Perceived haven assets were in vogue in the currency space, with the Yen benefitting particularly. However, its strength weighed heavily on the Nikkei’s plentiful export titans. One currency for which Turkish contagion is a big issue is of course the Euro. It wallowed at 13-month lows against the Dollar as investors looked askance at the currency bloc’s major banks and weighed their likely links to Turkey. 
$$$$
EUR/USD has just slipped through the 50% Fibonacci retracement of its rise up from the lows of December 2016 to the peaks of February this year. That came in at 1.1439. The next, 76.4% pullback would be seen a long way down from current levels at 1.1176.
$$$$
Gold prices were subdued as the Dollar firmed while crude oil prices slipped back on decreased risk appetite, although US sanctions against major producer Iran seem to be underpinning the market now.
$$$$
The rest of the day offers no first-tier economic numbers, which means current themes are likely to endure through the European and American sessions.

EURUSD continues its journey lower as the Turkish Lira weakens further. Late last week reports showing EU bank exposure to Turkey rattled the single-currency and today’s fall – USDTRY hit a fresh all time low around 7.20 – compounded the problem. The Lira did rebound back below 7.00 after the Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said that the government had a plan to restore calm and that ‘institutions will take the necessary actions as of Monday morning’. This warning gave USDTRY a short-term bounce, but markets remain likely to sell the Lira into any strength, unless the Finance Minister’s announcement deters the bears. Last week a report in the Financial Times highlighted European bank’s exposure to the Turkish Lira, prompting a sell-off in the financial space.
$$$$
EURUSD currently trades below 1.1400 and may fall back to levels last seen over a year ago. Previous support levels at 1.1448 and 1.1554 now turn into resistance, while the next level of support – the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the January 2017/February 2018 rally – does not come into play until 1.1187. The pair trade below all three moving averages but have dipped into RSI oversold territory and may find a short-term reprieve before moving lower.

$$$$
EURUSD remains near its recent low and is unlikely to break out of a narrow trading range in the short-term. The US dollar is nudging lower after its impressive run-up of late, while the Euro remains weighed down by Turkish contagion fears and elevated Italian bond yields – 10-year Italian bonds yield in excess of 3.10%. The data calendar is quiet for both the Euro and the dollar until the back-end of next week, apart from the FOMC minutes after the Europe close on Wednesday, leaving little to drive the pair.
$$$$
The US dollar basket (DXY) currently trades marginally lower after its recent surge and may test the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 95.87. A break below here would open up support around old highs at 95.20.
$$$$
The daily EURUSD chart below shows the new trading zone between 1.1301, the recent low, and the double-low at 1.1509. Before that the 50% retracement level at 1.1448 needs to be respected and may prove difficult to break. The RSI indicator is coming out of oversold territory but the downtrend from late-July remains in place.
$$$$
The four-hour EURUSD chart also points to a tight trading range with additional barriers to the upside provided by the 20- and 50-day moving average with the latter coinciding with the 50% retracement level.

After breaking below 1.1400 at the end of last, EURUSD has remained in a 1.1365-1.1433 range for the last three trading sessions. The bearish sentiment in the pair was boosted by the ongoing strength in USDTRY, prompting fears that European bank exposure to the weak Turkish Lira could cause balance sheet problems going forward. Recent Euro-Zone data and sentiment indicators have generally met expectations, giving the single currency little help, while in the US, data watchers are waiting for the latest retail sales release (Wednesday 12:30 GMT) and the University of Michigan Sentiment report (Friday 14:00 GMT).

A look at the daily chart below shows how EURUSD is stuck below the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the Janaury 2017 – February 2018 rally at 1.1448 which may prove difficult to break through, all things being equal. In the bottom right of the chart, the RSI indicator is in oversold territory which may provide solace for EURUSD bulls. One of the two indicators will eventually brak and the current market indecision will be erased. The last tow candles on the chart highlight this current indecision and tonight’s close may offer more clues for the EURUSD short-term prospects. A break higher targets 1.1540 before the 20-day moving average at 1.15874 while a further move lower should find strong support at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.11870.

Dollar Index Breaks Through Resistance, Volume Confirms Move	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/08/14/Dollar-Index-Breaks-Through-Resistance-Volume-Confirms-Move.html	1534276800	"
Strong volume in futures contracts reinforce U.S. Dollar strength 
$$$$
Large speculators have been selling Euro futures, but are still net long
$$$$
The strong Dollar trend continues with further room for EUR/USD to fall towards 1.1200
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
On Friday, the U.S. Dollar broke out as the ICE’s DXY Dollar Index reached one-year highs. The move seems to be a confluence of factors: general Dollar strength combined with reports that the European Central Bank (ECB) is concerned with Europe’s exposure to a plummeting Turkish Lira. This concern might further the idea that the ECB is far from normalizing its interest-rate policy, a narrative that may keep pressure on the Euro. 
$$$$
But in addition to an uncertain fundamental picture, Friday’s move is confirmed by strong volume in futures markets, as well as the fact that large speculators are still net long Euro futures contracts. All of this could send the U.S. Dollar Index towards 100, its next major level of resistance.

Strong futures volume reinforces U.S. Dollar strength 
$$$$
Friday’s move in the U.S. Dollar saw strong volume, both in the Euro and U.S. Dollar Index futures contracts. When volume confirms a technical breakout, it shows broad participation. Though there are one buyer and one seller to each contract, high volume indicates that more market players participated in price discovery, lending support and validity to the move. 
$$$$
Such broad participation was the case on Friday when volume in the U.S. Dollar Index futures contract reached 43,668 contracts. That equates to 1.5-2x recent averages and was the highest volume in nearly two months. 
$$$$
In Euro futures, volume reached 461,395 contracts, the most since the EUR/USD’s last sharp decline on June 14. On that day, the Euro shed more than 220 pips, compared with the nearly 115 pips on Friday. Recently, Euro futures volume has hovered around 250,000 contracts per day for the front-month contract. 
$$$$
(Futures contracts are currency contracts associated for specific months. The “front-month contract” is where most of the trading occurs, which is the closest month of March, June, September and December in currency futures.)
$$$$
Large speculators have been selling Euro futures, but are still net long
$$$$
When we look at the CFTC’s Commitment of Traders (COT) Report on Euro futures, we see that large speculators have been net long Euros since May 2017. The peak of their net long positioning, unsurprisingly, occurred in April 2018 – two months after a February rally took EUR/USD to its recent highs. During the Euro’s 900-pip decline since, large speculators have sold most of those longs, bringing the positioning down from long 151,476 contracts on April 17 to long just 10,565 contracts on August 7. 
$$$$
But two factors may suggest that the EUR/USD has more room to weaken – and potentially in the near-term. First, large speculators are still net long Euros. They can (and probably will) go net short. Second, on a week-to-week basis, speculators’ positioning is simply trending lower – not jumping lower. 
$$$$
For example, last week, when we talked about how large speculators covered their net short Canadian Dollar futures positioning by the largest amount this year, I noted that large changes in positioning were often a contrarian indicator for the currency. In that case, I argued that buying back Canadian Dollar futures may suggest that the Canadian Dollar was poised to weaken further. 
$$$$
However, a week-over-week move of 12,000 Euro contracts in the two most-recent COT Reports is a modest change in Euro positioning. In June, there was a 52,000 contract change – a move that was followed by two months of consolidating prices. 
$$$$
The strong Dollar trend continues with further room for EUR/USD to fall towards 1.12 
$$$$
Looking at the technicals, EUR/USD could fall towards 1.1200 as a next target. That is the last point of consolidation during the pair’s 2017 rally and could easily be reached if concerns continue over Turkey. 
$$$$
Ultimately, if the Dollar’s strength continues, EUR/USD could even fall towards the 1.0800 level, the price where it was trading ahead of the 2017 French election (blue arrow).

$$$$
EURUSD has dropped to its lowest level since July 2017 and could yet fall further as the recent slide in the Turkish Lira raises concerns about European banks’ exposure to Turkey.
$$$$
Losses for the pair have been exacerbated by the strength of the US Dollar, which is seen increasingly as a “safe haven” for investors wishing to reduce their risk. The Dollar Index, which measures it against a basket of other currencies, is at its highest level since June last year.
$$$$
The Euro is weak elsewhere too, falling for example to its weakest point since August last year against the Swiss Franc, which is also seen as a haven currency. However, it is the Euro’s losses against the US Dollar which are currently in the spotlight.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
The key levels to watch out for now for EURUSD are the lows at 1.1179 and then 1.1119 touched on June 27 and June 20 last year. Note, though, that retail trader positioning data show traders are less net-long than yesterday and compared with last week – suggesting a possible rally from a contrarian perspective.
$$$$
As for the Turkish Lira, that continues to recover some of its recent losses.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
The Lira has been helped by central bank action to squeeze Lira liquidity, effectively tightening monetary policy. However, there are few signs of a truce in Turkey’s dispute with the US over Turkey’s detention of an American pastor. Turkey has doubled tariffs on some US imports in retaliation for similar US moves.

Italy's League Calls for ECB Bond Guarantee, Warns of Euro Collapse	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/08/13/Italys-League-Calls-for-ECB-Bond-Guarantee-Warns-of-Euro-Collapse-.html	1534195800	"
Italian government officials are adding pressure to other risk concerns related to Turkey
$$$$
The League’s comments could revive concern over anti-EU sentiment from Italy’s League
$$$$
The spread between the Italian and German 10-year government bond yield is 2.76%
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
The unity of the Eurozone and European Central Bank were pressured again Monday, after Italian Minister Claudio Borghi called for capped yield spreads on Eurozone bonds. Mr. Borghi is the League’s economic spokesman and president of the lower house budget committee. The League party has been governing jointly with the Five-Star Movement since June, after an inconclusive election in March. Borghi’s apprehension echoes anti-EU sentiment held by both parties now guiding Italy leading up to the election.
$$$$
Check out our Economic Calendar for upcoming economic data and central bank events. 
$$$$
Following the Turkish lira’s recent loss of value, Italian bonds rose to their highest levels in two months. Similarly, Spanish and Greek yields also advanced as investors look to ‘de-risk’. Borghi argued the contagion spreading from Turkey to some Eurozone economies showed that Italy’s domestic and economic situation was not the main reason for market pressure on its stocks and bonds in recent days. 
$$$$
To combat this, he asserted that the European Central Bank offer a guarantee to cap yield spreads in the Eurozone. “The situation can’t be resolved and it is going to explode” he later said, referring to the shared euro currency. His suggested remedy was a 150 basis point limit on the spread between Eurozone country’s bonds. “Either the ECB offers a guarantee or the euro will be dismantled,” he concluded.
$$$$
Despite the negative comments regarding the bloc, the League has repeatedly denied any plans to exit the single currency system since aligning with the Five-Star Movement. The recent stance maintained by the League could have contributed to the muted response in the EURUSD pairing. The more headline-worthy concerns in the country’s and region’s exposure to Turkish debt pressured by the exchange rate likely further complicated the Euro’s response. At the time of this article the pair traded around 1.1405, hardly changed from open. 
$$$$
EUR/USD Price Chart, 15-Minute Time Frame, August 13
$$$$
The yield on an Italian 10-year bond reached 3.109% following the lira’s depreciation, a level not seen since the political uncertainty following the March election. Spanish 10-years climbed to 1.45% and Greece’s has rebound to 4.29% despite a recent credit upgrade. The rising yields contrast the German Bund’s position as Europe’s safe haven, as the gap between Italian and German bond yields briefly reached 280 basis points. Moving forward, further comments or actions that insinuate Italy might leave the single currency system will undoubtedly impact the currency.

Stocks, NZD/USD May Rise if Turkey Contagion Fears Keep Easing	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/08/14/Stocks-NZDUSD-May-Rise-if-Turkey-Contagion-Fears-Keep-Easing.html	1534222800	"
Most Asia/Pacific benchmark stock indexes climbed as Turkey contagion fears eased

China’s Shanghai Composite fell though, digesting a miss in key local economic data
$$$$
Continued gains in Europe and US shares may keep lifting AUD/USD and NZD/USD
"	"
Check out our 3Q forecasts for the Euroand equities to see where they may go in the DailyFX Trading Guides page
$$$$
Most Asia/Pacific benchmark stock indexes traded higher after Monday’s aggressive selloff that was largely triggered by fears of financial contagion to Turkey. A lack of updates and developments out of the country as the Turkish Lira traded sideways against the US Dollar offered the markets a breather and room for consolidation.
$$$$
You will find some of the best performing indexes in Japan. The Nikkei 225, led to the upside by all sectors, rallied more than 1.5% and pared most of its gap and losses from yesterday. The ASX 200 edged higher about 0.75% heading into Tuesday’s close, supported by all but the health care and real estate sectors. South Korea’s KOSPI climbed about 0.33%.
$$$$
Meanwhile, Chinese shares were unable to capitalize on the general improvement in market mood as the Shanghai Composite declined 0.5%. China experienced disappointing retail sales and industrial production statistics for July, the month in which US tariffs on some of their goods went into effect. However, this negativity from the world’s second largest economy failed to meaningfully permeate into nearby stock markets. 
$$$$
As such, the sentiment-linked Australian and New Zealand Dollars were able to capitalize on the improvement in risk trends. The anti-risk Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc on the other hand depreciated across the board. Gold prices, the anti-fiat commodity, bottomed after the US Dollar halted its aggressive ascent over the past few days. This allowed the precious metal to consolidate.
$$$$
Some emerging market currencies were still feeling the pressure though during Tuesday Asia trade. In particular, the Indonesia Rupiah, Malaysian Ringgit and Philippine Peso edged lower against the US Dollar. This followed a rather poor performance from the MSCI Emerging Markets ETFwhich helped drag down the S&P 500 on Monday. Second quarter foreign direct investment in Indonesia dropped about 13% y/y in dollar terms. 
$$$$
Unless more updates increase Turkish contagion fears ahead, European shares could echo the rather upbeat mood from markets seen during the Asia/Pacific trading session. This may boost stocks and add more momentum to AUD’s and NZD’s ascent. The Euro could rally too, but worse-than-expected Eurozone and German GDP data could cap EUR/USD gains and even send it closer to the May/June 2017 lows.
$$$$
Find out what the #1 mistake that traders make is and how you can fix it! 
$$$$
After breaking below key near-term support, NZD/USD finds itself struggling to push below the 38.2% Fibonacci extension around 0.6588. In fact, the recent improvement in market mood has led the pair cautiously higher. In the event of more market dynamics that could bolster sentiment, the pair may bounce back to the lows which is struggled to push through in the first place. This is around the 23.6% level and May 2016 low (0.6692 – 0.6676).

$$$$
The Euro wilted quite sharply as Asian trade faded out on Friday, with worries about Turkey widely reported to be behind the move.
$$$$
The Turkish Lira was hammered this week.USD/TRY has soared and the Lira has lost about 30% of its value against the greenback this year alone. Now it seems that possible contagion to European banks exposed to Turkey is an additional worry for investors. 
$$$$
The Financial Times has reported that the Eurozone’s financial watchdog - the Single Supervisory Mechanism - is concerned about the exposure of major lenders such as Unicredit, BBVA and BNP Paribas to Turkish business.
$$$$
EUR/USD duly slipped below the 1.1500 handle, getting as low as 1.1432 before stabilizing back above 1.1450. 
$$$$
The move came against the backdrop of a generally stronger US Dollar and Japanese Yen as trade-war fears saw investors pile back into perceived haven assets. Now Turkey seems to be giving them a reason to double down on this trade.
$$$$
With memories of the Eurozone’s own banking crisis still raw, it seems likely that Turkish headlines will weigh on the Euro for some considerable time to come.
$$$$Friday will bring some more risk events on this subject. President Erdogan is due to speak at 1100GMT, and again at 1330, with Finance Minister Berat Albyrak crossing the wires with a new economic programme at 1130. $$$$

The US dollar rally has taken another leg higher, hitting a new 13-month peak, after the latest US PPI numbers showed inflation remaining robust, keeping another 5 US rate hikes over the next 18-months firmly in place. US CPI is released at 12:30 GMT today and another strong reading could push the US dollar even higher.

And as the greenback rallied, the commodity space fell further with gold now sitting just above a noted support level and looking to press lower. A failure to hold $1,205/oz. will leave the precious metal looking at $1,195/oz. as the next level of support.
$$$$
EURUSD broke below the psychological 1.1500 barrier with ease Friday on a combination of a strong dollar and a warning by the ECB over European banks’ exposure to the Turkish Lira, which hit a multi-decade low against the greenback.
$$$$According to sources, President Erdogan is expected to speak at 11:00 GMT today, while Finance Minister Albayrak reveals the country's new economic model at 11.30 GMT before President Erdogan speaks again at 13.30 GMT. $$$$

GBP Pares Losses as GDP Bounces Back, However, Brexit Remains Key Driver	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/08/10/GBP-Pares-Losses-as-GDP-Bounces-Back-However-Brexit-Remains-Key-Driver.html	1533894120	"
UKQ2 GDP Bounces Back
$$$$
GBP Finds Little Support as Brexit Continues to Present the Biggest Obstacle
"	"
GBPUSD Analysis and News
$$$$
For a more in-depth analysis on Sterling, check out the Q3 Forecast for GBP/USD
$$$$
The UK economy picked up in Q2 after the weather hit slowdown seen in Q1. The first look at the Q2 GDP data showed a quarterly reading of 0.4%, taking the yearly rate to 1.3%, both readings had been in line with expectations. Consequently, this bounce back is likely to reassure the Bank of England in their decision to raise rates to 0.75% last week. Alongside the GDP figures, the ONS had released the latest manufacturing, construction and industrial output data, which overall had been generally firmer than expected. As such, this may provide a bit of life for the Pound, which has taken a hit this week.
$$$$
What has been made apparent over the past week is that Brexit remains to be the key driver in the near term for GBP. Recent comments made by the UK Trade Minister that a “no-deal” Brexit is the most likely scenario, has seen markets reprice the possibility of a “no-deal”, prompting GBPUSD to fall to its lowest level since mid-2017, with the pair down 2.7% this month. This has also been reflected in option markets with options buyers increasing their demand for protection against deeper GBPUSD declines as risk reversals fall to levels since in early 2017.
$$$$
Latest Trade Idea: GBPCAD Short: Rate Differentials Favour CAD, Brexit Weighs on GBP
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
GBPUSD weaker on the back of the USD reaching fresh YTD highs as the rout in emerging markets begin to raise the threat of contagion in the EU. This followed reports from the FT that European banks have a notable amount of exposure to the Turkish Lira and thus leading to EURUSD breaking below key support at 1.15.
$$$$
IG Client Positioning shows that 74.4% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.9 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since Apr 20 when GBPUSD traded near 1.40858; price has moved 9.3% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 0.1% lower than yesterday and 3.0% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 7.1% lower than yesterday and 4.0% lower from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests GBPUSD prices may continue to fall. Traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger GBPUSD-bearish contrarian trading bias.

USD Could Fall Further on Trump's Troubles, US-China Trade Worries	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/08/23/USD-Could-Fall-Further-on-Trumps-Troubles-US-China-Trade-Worries.html	1535011200	"
The US Dollar’s recent weakness looks set to be extended as traders worry about an escalation of the US-China trade wars and allegations of wrongdoing by US President Donald Trump. 
$$$$
These factors are likely to outweigh the prospect of higher US interest rates and USD’s safe-haven status.
"	"
Our trading forecasts for Q3 have been published; you can find the USD guide here.
$$$$
Prospects for the US Dollar look poor near-term as the US-China trade war escalates, with both sides implementing 25% tariffs on $16 billion of each other’s goods despite low-level trade talks in Washington designed to bring the US and China closer together.
$$$$
In addition, concerns are mounting about criminal probes into US President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and ex-campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Investors are considering whether the setback would hurt his Republican Party’s mid-term election prospects and EURUSD has rallied as a result, along with several other currencies and commodities.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
On the flipside, US Dollar weakness could be contained by its status as a safe-haven when investors wish to reduce their exposure to risky assets and by continuing expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates again next month. The minutes of the last meeting of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee made it clear that its members are considering another rate hike soon.
$$$$
From a technical perspective, as the chart above shows, USD has rallied this session but the climb in EURUSD that began on August 16 could well resume. If it manages to recover above 1.16 there could well be a climb to just under 1.17, where trendline resistance and the 100-day moving average could impede its progress. Support lies close to 1.15.
$$$$
Retail trader sentiment data also point to gains in EURUSD, with 57% currently net-short the pair and only 43% net long.

News that the US and Mexico have reached a deal on NAFTA has boosted traders’ risk appetite.

With USD seen as a safe haven, the currency has weakened and may continue to drop.
"	"
Our trading forecasts for Q3 have been published; you can find the USD guide here.
$$$$

$$$$
Trader optimism has been boosted by news that the US and Mexico have reached a deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), lessening demand for the safe-haven US Dollar. Looking ahead, that weakness could continue as traders opt for riskier assets such as stocks.
$$$$
The NAFTA deal has focused attention on Canada to sign up to it and also on the EU to speed up tariff talks, as asked for by the US.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
As the EURUSD chart above shows, the pair has been rising steadily since August 15 and is now at its highest level so far this month, knocking on the door of the psychologically important 1.17 level. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq US stock indexes have reached record closing highs and USDCAD has reached its lowest since early June as pressure rises on Canada to strike a NAFTA deal too.
$$$$
The US/Mexico agreement has outweighed comments by US President Donald Trump that now is “not the right time to talk” to China about the two countries’ trade war and has also boosted the prices of commodities such as US crude oil, which has been rising since hitting a $64/barrel low two weeks ago.
$$$$
So now the USD downtrend looks set to persist for as long as “risk on” remains the dominant market theme.

$$$$
The DailyFX Q3 forecasts and analysis of USD and EUR are just two of the major currencies available to download here.
$$$$
As we close the week, EURUSD is under the spotlight as a raft of political events appear in view. And the single-block currency is likely to slip lower as negative sentiment builds.
$$$$
First up, US EU trade wars are once again back in the headlines as President Trump continues with his bombastic campaign. Yesterday reports revealed that the EU may well cancel all tariffs on US industrial products, including cars, to scale back trade tensions between the two economies. However, US President Trump, who originally called for this stance, has now said that his offer is ‘not good enough’ adding that European consumer habits ‘are to buy their cars, not to buy our cars’. This latest intervention by POTUS leaves the very real possibility of further, drawn out trade wars between the EU and US.
$$$$
Turkish Lira volatility continues with USDTRY swinging sharply in a wide range. European bank chiefs will continue to monitor this situation closely with some more exposed to Turkish risk than others.

Euro Dollar traders will need to watch political developments in Italy closely, especially ongoing budget and immigration negotiations. The ruling Italian coalition remains at loggerheads over whether the country will comply with the EU’s 3% of GDP deficit rule, while Italian Deputy PM recently said that the country may not sign-off the EU’s seven-year budget plan unless the current immigration situation changes.
$$$$
Italian 10-year government yields – a political risk barometer – continue to move higher and are now nudging levels last seen back in May 2014. In contrast, German 10-year bonds offer just 0.38%, French 10-years yield 0.70%, while Greek 10-years are quoted at 4.18%, albeit in a thin market.
$$$$
EURUSD is nearing important chart resistance levels and is edging towards overbought territory after the 4-cent rebound seen in the last two weeks. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the January 2017 – February 2018 rally is at 1.1710, while the November 2017 swing-low cuts across at 1.17175. The RSI indicator is at a six-month high and nears overbought territory. Bullish euro dollar traders can take strength from current price action above both the 20- and 50-day moving average and a strong break above the previously noted resistance levels would leave 1.19155 and 1.20330 (23.6% Fib retracement) as near- to medium-term targets.
$$$$
On the right-hand side of the pair, the US dollar is off its best-levels of late as traders try and balance future rate hike expectations and fears that “the hot-handed US Economy may have outrun the pack with little gas left in the tank”. If rate expectations are pared back further – a 0.25% hile in September is priced in but December’s hike is now looking more evenly balanced – EURUSD may well push aside Italian risk and continue to move higher.

EUR/USD Accepting of Italy's Outlook Downgrade, Remains 'BBB'	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/08/31/EURUSD-Accepting-of-Italys-Outlook-Downgrade-Remains-BBB.html	1535748720	"
Fitch ratings affirmed Italy at ‘BBB,’ downgraded outlook to negative from stable
$$$$
EUR/USD was down 0.57% on Friday but didn’t suffer on the ratings release
$$$$
Moody’s rating agency will offer their assessment of the country next Friday
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
Italy’s sovereign debt rating was affirmed by Fitch at ‘BBB’ Friday, but received a downgrade on their outlook from stable to negative. The time of the release led to little impact on the euro with European markets closed and the weekend underway. A steep drop in the EUR/USD pair earlier in the day suggests markets may have expected the downgrade or the news was released early to some parties. Either way, the downgrade does not bode well for Italy.
$$$$
Next week, Italy and the Eurozone may be dealt another blow when Moody’s provides their rating of the country. Currently, Moody’s rates Italy at ‘Baa2’ with a negative outlook, last updated May 25th of this year. With an already negative outlook, a rating downgrade would be a significant blow. Italian bond yields rest above 3.20 and the populist 5-Star Movement and League coalition continue to threaten the status quo of the European Union.

EUR/USD 15-Minute Price Chart, August 30 – 31
$$$$
As previously touched upon, the response in the euro was muted. A 15-minute chart of the EUR/USD pair showed euro strength fading earlier in the day, well before the rating action was released. Further, the euro had recently staged 12 consecutive days gaining ground against the greenback. Eventually this spree would have to break and Thursday’s resurgence of emerging market concern proved a sufficient catalyst. 
$$$$
EUR/USD 2-Hour Price Chart, August 17 – August 31
$$$$
Heading in to next week, the economic calendar has a distinct lack of high importance data for the Euro-area. With that in mind, markets will likely look to Moody’s rating action as the most important data piece of the week. The release is scheduled for Friday September 7th.

Weak Volume Puts Long-Term EUR/USD Move Higher in Doubt	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/08/28/Weak-Volume-Puts-Long-Term-EURUSD-Move-Higher-in-Doubt.html	1535492700	"
EUR/USD moved 3.4% higher over the past nine trading sessions. The next point of resistance comes at 1.1750
$$$$
Despite the strong price reversal, volume in the EUR futures contract remained average. Typically, large reversals are made on strong volume
$$$$
The market is moving back into an area of balance, potentially to continue formation of a large head-and-shoulders pattern
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
Over the past two weeks, EUR/USD bounced significantly off of one-year lows. On the chart, this is an impressive reversal of a decline that started in April. However, looking at the EUR futures contract, we see that the move higher was not accompanied by strong volume. Typically, volume confirms reversals – showing that more traders are initiating positions and accepting the higher price.

EUR/USD’s two-week rally follows a break below 1.15 to new, one-year lows. The recent rally equates to a 3.4% move higher (from the 1.13 lows to 1.1680 at present) and is one of the larger multi-day moves in the currency pair since late May. 
$$$$
Zooming out on the chart, the next point of resistance is the July 31 highs of 1.1750 (black line) in the near term. Additionally, significant resistance may form between there and the June 14 highs at 1.1850 (red line). With these levels overhead, there appears to be mounting pressure for EUR bulls.
$$$$
Traders look for high volume to confirm the validity of market moves, particularly as trends reverse. That’s because with high volume comes broader participation. If you think of the market as a discounting mechanism, higher volume means that more participants are involved in setting the price. In turn, that means that the price they agree on is more broadly viewed as the equilibrium price. 
$$$$
Since forex is decentralized, volume is difficult to gauge. However, futures markets can add this missing piece. In the CME’s September Euro future, volume remained below 250,000 contracts a day during most of this rally. This compares to volume on the August 10th decline of 453,203 contracts. 
$$$$
Now that we are in the last week of summer, it’s unlikely volume will kick in this week. That could be setting us up for a very interesting start to September. 
$$$$
Technical patterns are rarely this obvious. In fact, it’s hard to look at a daily chart of EUR/USD and not see a clear head and shoulders pattern forming. The recent rally does not discount that pattern, but instead suggests that it may need more time to play out.
$$$$
In fact, the left shoulder and head took around five months to form and play out. The left shoulder first made a low in July 2017 before breaking out in January 2018. The head formed from January through May/June, when prices broke down. And the right shoulder has been forming since then. Similar timing would suggest that this formation could take until October to finalize the pattern. 
$$$$
As long as prices stay below May’s high at 1.20, this formation is valid. If prices break down below support at the 1.13 double bottom from July 2017 and August 2018, then there may be more downside to come. A rally above 1.20 would suggest that prices could move towards the February highs.

The US Dollar outperformed against its major counterparts on Friday amidst haven bids, with its appreciation picking up pace during the European trading session. There the DAX and Euro Stoxx 50 declined after market open, echoing weakness in Asia Pacific indexes. Broad Euro declines amidst worse-than-expected Eurozone CPI data also lifted the greenback as hawkish ECB monetary policy bets fell.
$$$$
US stocks were on pace to end the day lower, but an update on NAFTA sent the S&P 500 rallying which caused it to close little changed. Despite a report that US-Canada trade talks stalled, Wall Street rejoiced the outcome as the NASDAQ Composite rose alongside the S&P 500. Canadian benchmark equities on the other hand fared worse as the TSX declined on the update.
$$$$
This could have been the case due to the world’s largest economy essentially securing an agreement with its southern neighbor. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer noted that Trump will sign a deal with just Mexico, but only leaving the door open to Canada “if it is willing”. Negotiations between the United States and its northern neighbor are to resume on Wednesday. 
$$$$
Pro-risk currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand Dollars depreciated as market mood deteriorated throughout most of the day. AUD/USD suffered its largest daily decline in more than one week as it closed at its lowest point this year so far. But the pair could decline in the week ahead. Meanwhile the anti-risk currencies such as the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc appreciated.
$$$$
This week begins with a partial drain in liquidity as US markets are closed for the Labor Day holiday. As a result, stocks and currencies could be vulnerable to sudden changes in sentiment. This could come from trade war fears if China announces retaliation on threats of additional $200b in US tariffs. European markets could also be left vulnerable after Fitch lowered Italy’s rating outlook to negative from stable. This was a result of rising deficit concerns as economic nationalism threatens EUR/USD.
$$$$
EUR/USD prices have closed under a near-term rising trend line that began with a bullish reversal pattern. The pair stopped its descent in a rising channel of support/resistance, but Euro weakness in the days ahead could see the pair drop to 1.1531 next. This area kept the pair afloat through June and July, it may reestablish itself as support. Meanwhile, a near-term resistance is above the August 28th high at 1.1744.

In what is expected to be a quiet session due to the US Labour Day Holiday, EURUSD currently sits on a noted technical support level and looks weak in the short-term. Trading ranges are expected to be narrow today, so a break lower may not occur soon, but technical indicators currently point to a lower price.
$$$$
As seen on the four-hour chart below, EURUSD currently trades just above the 200-day moving average at 1.15852 and has held this level for the last five candles. The pair also trade below the 20- and 50-day moving average and remain at, or near, levels seen 10-days ago. The RSI indicator is back at a two-week low and just trading above oversold territory which may provide the pair with some short-term support.
$$$$
Late last week, rating’s agency Fitch left Italy’s credit rating (BBB) untouched but lowered its rating’s outlook to negative from stable. The agency said that they expect a ‘degree of fiscal loosening that would leave Italy’s very high level of public debt more exposed to potential shocks'. This warning from Fitch was followed by commentary from the Italian economy minister who said that they would come up with concrete policies to help them to respect their European Budget Commitments.

The US Dollar was on pace to deliver another solid day of gains as market mood deteriorated during APAC trade, fueling haven demand for the world’s reserve currency. This then turned around later in the day amidst reports that Germany and the UK dropped a key Brexit demand, potentially paving a smoother path for Britain to strike with the European Union on an exit deal.
$$$$
As a result, GBP/USD soared as much as 1.2% as the British Pound appreciated against its major counterparts. UK government bond yields rose, signaling firming BoE rate hike bets. This weighed against the US Dollar and earlier gains were pared. EUR/USD ended up posting its largest gain on the daily chart since August 27th.
$$$$
Following the market moving Brexit news, the BoC brought volatility to the Canadian Dollar and it could have gone better. The central bank left rates unchanged at 1.50% as expected, but failed to dial up expectations of a hike in October. USD/CAD rose, but finished the day little changed. With that in mind, it would probably take better-than-expected Canadian economic data ahead to revive hawkish bets. 
$$$$
Despite the Brexit update, sentiment continued deteriorating after Wall Street came online. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite declined, falling 0.28% and 1.19% respectively. This was led by weakness in information technology as US Senators increased prospects of regulating social media. Despite this, the anti-risk Japanese Yen ended the day weaker. Gains were offset by USD performance.
$$$$
Ahead, prolonged weakness in shares could see Asia Pacific trade echo the performance on Wall Street. This may lead the US Dollar higher as markets are still facing the potential of rising trade wars between the world’s largest economies. Meanwhile, the Australian Dollar faces a trade balance report. Yesterday’s stronger second quarter GDP report could offer a data beat. But gains on that may not last given that the RBA still does not intend on raising rates in the near-term.
$$$$
Even though EUR/USD rose Wednesday, the pair was unable to push out of channel resistance. In fact, the pair stopped right on the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement. Given the prospects of USD gains ahead, the Euro may find its next leg lower after this temporary pullback. This would resume its decline since late August after a descent through a near-term rising trend line. Immediate support is the 38.2% level at 1.1568.

$$$$
The Institute for Supply Management released manufacturing figures for August on Tuesday, providing fuel to drive the dollar higher. The report surpassed the expected and previous readings of 57.6 and 58.1 respectively. With a reading of 61.3, August’s manufacturing index marks the highest figure since May 2004 and the 112th month of consecutive growth for the United States economy. The increase supports the recent upwardly revised GDP figure and rising consumer confidence. The beat was not delivered by an outperformance of a specific sector but rather a broad increase across all industries. 
$$$$
Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 16 reported growth in August. Wood products and primary metals were the exceptions as ISM officials cited continued expanding business strength for the widespread growth. The new orders index remained above 60 for the 16th straight month and the inventories index remained low. Consumption approved despite shortages in labors and materials. Similarly, inputs expanded strongly despite steel and aluminum disruptions and continuing transportation difficulties. The broad outperformance and subsequent impact on the index, had a palpable effect on the dollar. 
$$$$
Early Tuesday morning, the dollar surged higher versus counterparts as the US economy shrugged off the turmoil afflicting many other markets. At the time of the report’s release, the dollar basket posted its largest rally of the day, culminating in a +0.56% rally to the 95.70 level.

Until then, emerging market fears may well be a driving factor as South Africa officially enters a recession and the downtrend of the Turkish lira and Argentine peso is extended.

However, while USD remains the go-to currency when market sentiment is poor, it will likely resume its ascent after a possible period of consolidation.

In the news, traders are waiting to hear about a possible escalation of the US-China trade war as a public consultation period on the US administration’s intent to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods ends today.
$$$$
In addition, news is awaited from US-Canada talks on a revamped NAFTA while financial turmoil in Argentina and Turkey remains a worry, as do figures released Thursday showing an unexpected fall in German industrial orders in July.
$$$$
However, the advance in DXY since a low of 94.43 on August 28 to above 95 currently looks set to resume soon after five days of consolidation. Moreover, trader sentiment data are flashing bearish signals on EURUSD and GBPUSD. The Euro is the principal component of DXY and GBP continues to suffer from a perceived lack of progress so far in the Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK.

The US Dollar Basket is back around 95.00 and pushing higher as the US returns to the fray after the Labour Day Holiday. The greenback has gained a safe-haven bid as US President Trump continues on his trade tariff crusade, while Emerging Markets continue to suffer, giving the USD an additional boost. And US dollar bulls may also be anticipating another strong US Labour Report of Friday as the economy continues to expand. Markets are expecting a short-200k+ NFP print, a 3.8%, fresh 18-year low unemployment rate (down from 3.9%) with average earnings at 0.2% m/m and constant at 2.7% y/y. 
$$$$
The US Dollar Basket (DXY) is now pushing back at the 95.00 level and looking to re-test the June double-high at 95.20 although this chart point’s relevance is not as strong as it was before. Above here, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 95.87 becomes a valid target ahead of the recent 14-month high at 96.60.

EURUSD Analysis: Pair Receives Boost on German State Inflation	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/07/30/EURUSD-Analysis-Pair-Receives-Boost-on-German-State-Inflation.html	1532948940	"
EURUSD finds support on German state inflation data
$$$$
However, easing inflation in most populous states poses downside risks.
"	"
Euro Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
For a more in-depth analysis on EUR, check out the Q3 Forecast for EUR
$$$$
The Euro has found a boost from German data as State inflation readings have mostly exceeded expectations of the mainland figure (0.4% m/m, 2.1% y/y) and prior readings. Consequently, this bodes well for the headline reading due to be released at 1200GMT. 
$$$$
However, downside risks remain as the most populous regions have in fact seen inflation ease from the prior month. North Whine-Westphalia, which is the most populous state saw annual inflation ease to 2%, while the second and third most populous states, Bavaria and Baden Wuerttemberg saw inflation ease to 2.2%. The notable drag on inflation had been due to the fall in clothing prices, while package holiday inflation had picked up.
$$$$
North Rhine Westphalia: 0.3% (Prev. 0.1%) M/M, 2.0% (Prev. 2.1%) Y/Y
$$$$
Baden-Wurttemberg: 0.2% (Prev. 0.2%) M/M, 2.2% (Prev. 2.4%) Y/Y
$$$$
Bavaria: 0.2% (Prev. 0.2%) M/M, 2.2% (Prev. 2.4%) Y/Y
$$$$
Hesse: 0.4% (Prev. 0%) M/M, 1.8% (Prev. 1.8%) Y/Y
$$$$
Brandenburg: 0.4% (Prev.0%) M/M, 2.2% (Prev. 2.2%) Y/Y
$$$$
Saxony: 0.4% (Prev. 0.1%) M/M, 2.2% (Prev. 2.1%)
$$$$
Overall, the data thus far continues to suggest that the ECB will remain cautious when winding down their bond buying program by the end of the year. Although, headline inflation is tracking around the ECB’s target, core inflation has failed to show an sustainable upward trajectory, which in turn led to the ECB reiterating the phrase that rates will remain at current levels until at least through the summer of 2019.
$$$$
EURUSD continues to trade within the 1.1850-1.1510 range with no signs of a break-out in the near term. Initial upside this morning has already been rejected by the 20DMA at 1.1690, while the descending trendline from the ECB June decision should keep price action capped. On the downside, the 1.16 handle will continue to act as support, with the base in EURUSD looking set at 1.1500-1.1510.

Strong US GDP to Add Pressure to EURUSD
"	"
EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q3 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
This morning participants digested the latest French GDP data for the second quarter, in which both the Q/Q and Y/Y readings underwhelmed expectations due to a series of strikes in the Euro Area’s second largest economy. This is the first published Q2 GDP estimate for a Eurozone economy and it points to downside risks for the data for the region as a whole due next week. The continued sluggishness in France also comes at a period of uncertainty marked by the global trade tensions.
$$$$
Later today we will see the US Q2 GDP, which is expected to surpass 4% for the first time since Q3 2014. Throughout the week, reports have suggested that the GDP figure could as strong as 4.8%. If indeed that is the case, this will likely provide added pressure to EURUSD, which is already reeling from yesterday’s ECB meeting whereby the Draghi stuck with the guidance that rates will remain at current levels through Summer 2019. Consequently, this has led to the continued widening of US-German bond spreads which have continued to move in favour of EUR selling.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
EURUSD continues to trade within its 1.1850-1.1580 range with no signs of a break-out. Although, US GDP may prompt EURUSD selling on a strong print, support remains situated from 1.1570-1.16 which could possibly stem the declines, while on the upside key resistance sits at 1.1720.
$$$$
IG client datashows 55.7% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.26 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 4.7% higher than yesterday and 1.2% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 10.0% lower than yesterday and 7.1% higher from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EURUSD prices may continue to fall. Positioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed EURUSD trading bias.

US Dollar Strength Persists: Euro, Yen, Pound and Gold Suffer	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/07/19/US-Dollar-Strength-Persists-Euro-Yen-Pound-and-Gold-Suffer.html	1531990800	"
USD remains on an upward path as Powell’s testimony and trade war fears outweigh profit-taking.
$$$$
That is weakening other currencies such as EUR, JPY and GBP, as well as gold.
"	"
Our trading forecasts for Q3 have been published; you can find the USD guide here.
$$$$
USD remains on an upward trajectory after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated Wednesday that he thinks the US economy is in rude good health, implying that the Fed will continue to raise US interest rates this year – perhaps twice more.
$$$$
In a second day of testimony to Congress, he also downplayed trade war fears but that failed to boost the “risk on” currencies despite some profit-taking in USD after its recent strength.
$$$$
The US Dollar basket (DXY), which measures it against a range of other major currencies, moved closer to the highs reached on June 21 at 95.21 and June 28 at 95.20 – its strongest levels for a year.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
Other major currencies, including the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the British Pound all suffered from Dollar strength. EURUSD is falling Thursday for the third successive session, although it remains in the middle of a sideways channel it has traded in since May.
$$$$
USDJPY remains in the upward channel that also began in May and is now not far from its highs for the year, while GBPUSD continues to be damaged by the political turmoil in the UK over Brexit, Wednesday’s news that UK inflation in June was lower than analysts had predicted and data on Thursday showing UK retail sales last month were below the levels forecast.
$$$$
As for gold, that has now eased for three consecutive sessions and looks to be breaking lower, out of a downward channel in place since the gold price hit a high of $1,365.36 on April 11. Trader sentiment data suggest further downside for gold, as well as for EURUSD and GBPUSD.

EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q3 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
Fed Chair Powell will be delivering his Semi-Annual Testimony before the Senate Panel at 14:00GMT, which will be the biggest focus for FX traders today. Since his appointment, Powell has largely avoided to cause a stir in the markets during his public addresses, as such there is possibility that the Fed Chair could re-emphasis the themes from the June FOMC meeting minutes by supporting the Fed’s current economic and rate path, whereby two more rate rises are seen this year.
$$$$
Alongside this, the Fed Chair stated in an interview last week that the US economy is in a “good place” given the recent government tax and spending programs, consequently, this upbeat assessment is unlikely to change. Additionally, with Fed Fund futures only pricing in 74bps worth of tightening in 2019, compared the Fed’s projection of 125bps, there is scope for USD upside. If Powell reaffirms the case that the Fed will hike two times next year, this may prompt an unwind of the recent US/German yield spread tightening from the widest point in 30yrs, pushing the EURUSD rate lower.
$$$$
Undoubtedly, one of the key subjects will be on the Fed’s thinking in regard to trade wars and its economic implications. In the FOMC’s June minutes, the Fed were cognizant about global trade risks, noting that these risks had intensified and were concerning, Powell also noted that trade disputes or high tariffs will be negative for the economy. As such, any hints that this would derail from its current rate path trajectory could lead to a sell-off in the USD-index. 
$$$$
The narrowing 2/10yr US bond spread has provided some concerns for many investors with the spread now a mere 26bps. Typically, a flattening yield curve, which inverts normally signals that a recession is on horizon, as was the case before the financial crisis. Consequently, focus will be also be placed on Powell’s view on the flattening curve.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
The rising trendline from January 2017 continues to offer support for the pair, which sits at 1.1650. An upbeat Fed Chair Powell testimony could see this tested. On the upside, initial targets are seen at 1.1753, which marks the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement of the 1.2555-1.1508 fall.
$$$$
IG Client Positioning Sentiment states that 51.8% of traders are net-long, suggesting that prices may continue to fall.

IHS Markit survey implies Q3 growth of 0.4%, down from 0.5% in Q2

EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q3 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
Eurozone PMI data for July failed to follow the strong German data with the services figure underwhelming expectations at 54.4, representing a 2-month low. Manufacturing PMI was the only better than expected figure, led by Germany and France. Overall, the slightly softer Eurozone PMI survey has dampened the sentiment in the Euro, which has pulled back from its initial gains stemming from the better than expected German report. 
$$$$
Consequently, this suggests that the Eurozone has started the second half of the year on a relatively soft footing, whereby IHS Markit have noted that the July reading is consistent with GDP of 0.4% for Q3, down from the 0.5% in Q2.

EURUSD – Retail are 50.3% net-long – mixed trading bias.
$$$$
Gold – Retail are 86.5% long but chages show mildly bullish contrarian bias.
$$$$
The dollar firmed late-Monday after news that US President Trump had indicated that this Friday’s first look at US Q2 GDP would reveal a much stronger-than-expected print of 4.8%, sharply higher than marekt expectations of 4%-4.3%.  Rumors are rumors and should be treated as such but the President has recent form on leaking economic news after he recently said that the US jobs market report would bring very good news, just hours before a much better-than-expected NFP release.
$$$$
The dollar has rallied back against the euro in the last two days and is now pressing back below the 20-and 50-day moving average. The RSI is also pointing lower and the pair may begin to re-test support levels between 1.15880 and the recent double-lows at 1.15080. Below here 1.14480.
$$$$
The price of gold jumped Monday on the weaker dollar but sold off again in the afternoon, post-Trump rumor. The precious metal continues to held back by the downtrend that started off the April 11 high at $1,365/oz. On the downside, the $1,215/oz. is likely to tested again and if it fails to hold, $1,204/oz. comes into play ahead of $1,194/oz. On the upside, the downtrend cuts across at $1,236, the December 12 swing-low, and will provide stubborn resistance.

The Euro was little changed Tuesday after purchasing managers’ indexes for the Eurozone in July showed the manufacturing sector expanding more quickly than expected but relative weakness in services. Looking ahead, the key event for the region this week will be Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank’s Governing Council, which will almost certainly leave all its settings where they are.

In this webinar, I looked at the numbers, the Euro and what to expect from the ECB on Thursday.

$$$$
You can read more about the data here
$$$$
The manufacturing PMI climbed to 55.1 from 54.9 in June, well above both the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction and the predicted 54.6. However, the services PMI eased to 54.4 from 55.2, well below the forecast 55.0. The composite PMI slipped to 54.3 from 54.9, under the expected 54.8.
$$$$
Taken together, the numbers suggest Q3 GDP growth of 0.4% according to IHS Market, which compiles the data. As for the Euro, that will likely be unaffected by Thursday’s ECB meeting, with EURUSD likely to react more to events in the US, where Friday’s GDP figures are the key economic data released this week.

Trade wars and tariffs back on the US-EU menu.

The latest IG Client Sentiment Indicator shows retail are 53.7% long EURUSD yet recent positional changes give us a mixed trading outlook.

The DailyFX Q3 Forecasts and Analysis of USD and EUR are available to download here.
$$$$
The contentious EU-US trade war continues and is likely to drive EURUSD in the short-term as US President Donald Trump welcomes European Commission President Jean Claude-Juncker to Washington today. Talks will be focussed on ongoing trade tensions - not helped by President Trump tweeting ‘Tariffs are the greatest’ on Tuesday – with the US looking for both sides to drop all tariffs. The EU currently impose a 10% tariff on US automobiles - five times more than the US currently imposes on EU autos – and the US has said they will slap on a 20% automobile tariff shortly if this differential is not addressed. The US recently imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminium.
$$$$
EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger tried to smooth the path Tuesday when he said that the EU would look at ways to reduce tariffs with the US adding that the EU ‘want to avoid a further escalation of the trade conflict, and to avoid a trade war’. This however may become increasingly difficult to achieve, especially with the current lowly rate of the euro against the dollar. President Trump recently tweeted that both China and the EU have been ‘manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower’ taking away the US competitive edge'.  
$$$$
The divergent monetary policy path of the two currencies is accentuating the problem between the US and the EU and it is likely to continue. The US 2-year currently yields a multi-year high around 2.65% while the 2-year German equivalent continues to trade with a negative yield, currently -0.615%. This differential continues to weaken EURUSD, a bone of contention with US President Trump. The latest ECB monetary policy meeting on Thursday will see all rates left unchanged while the next Fed meeting is expected to see interest rates raised by another 0.25%, the third hike this year. ECB President Mario Draghi will be questioned about the current EURUSD exchange rate at tomorrow’s post-announcement press conference and he will need to tread a careful path to avoid annoying the US further.
$$$$
EURUSD currently trades just below 1.1700 and has bounced off the 1.1500-1.1530 area four times in the past two months indicating that there may be some kind of central bank ‘line in the sand’ at this level. Fibonacci resistance at 1.1710 will be vulnerable to a positive outcome between the EU and US today leaving the July 9 high of 1.1791 the next target.

$$$$
The threat of a burgeoning trade war between the United States and European Union seems to have diminished Wednesday. US President Donald Trump met with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to talk trade in Washington DC and the meeting seems to have resulted in concessions from the bloc and relief from relentless US pressure. The announcement initially sent the euro higher versus the dollar and US equities rallied in afternoon trading with the initial leaks of progress. The deal comes as a surprise, contrasting reports from earlier in the day suggesting Juncker had no intention of securing a deal at the meeting. 
$$$$
Meeting in the Rose Garden of the White House, the two officials relayed their discussion to the press, confirming earlier leaked reports suggesting headway was being made. According to the proposed terms, the European Union will lower industrial tariffs, look to increase soybean and liquefied natural gas imports from the US, and the vague commitment to begin dialogue on reducing tariffs and “slashing costs dramatically.”
$$$$
President Trump expressed the importance of a strong relationship between the trading partners and went on to say the US and the EU will work together to reform the WTO. The pair will also work to resolve the steel and aluminum tariffs facing the EU – though they currently remain in place – and want to move towards “zero tariffs” on non-auto industrial goods. The timeline for the concessions is not immediately clear, but Mr. Juncker said the counterparts will “resist further tariffs as long as talks are ongoing”. This is perhaps the EU’s biggest take away from this meeting, but it is clear that negotiations to a truly satisfying outcome from both sides will take some time.

EURUSD currently trades around 1.17250, up around half-a-cent from Wednesday low, driven higher by positive news that the EU and the US would work together to bring non-auto industrial goods tariffs down to zero, reform the WTO while the EU would also buy more US soybeans and LNG. A positive start to negotiations but they still have to be ratified within the EU, while the EU automobile sector is still at risk, something that will continue to worry Germany.
$$$$
EURUSD move remains muted after the positive news, capped by the latest ECB meeting at 12:45pm and followed by a press conference at 13:30pm. All monetary policy settings will be left unchanged, leaving the single currency at the whim of ECB President Draghi’s question and answer session. President Draghi is expected to be asked for further clarity on last month’s forward guidance that interest rates will remain unchanged ‘at least through the summer of 2019’ and his thoughts on future QE reinvestments. As the summer lull approaches, Draghi is unlikely to say anything contentious or market moving, setting the tone for a quiet month ahead for EURUSD traders.

EUR Unchanged as the ECB Stands Pat on Monetary Policy
$$$$
Unsurprisingly, the ECB has stood pat on monetary policy with the refinancing, deposit and marginal lending rates left at 0%, -0.4% and 0.25% respectively, as expected. Given last month’s announcement regarding tapering of bond purchases later this year, little was expected from this meeting. Guidance from the ECB was also left unchanged with the central bank stating that “QE purchases will finish at the end of the year, subject to incoming data confirming medium term inflation outlook”, while “rates are expected to remain at current levels at least through summer of 2019”.
$$$$
As such, a minimal reaction has been observed in the Euro, while price action in German bond yields were also relatively muted post the monetary policy decision. Consequently, focus will now rest on ECB President Draghi’s press conference at 1230GMT with comments likely to centre around clarity regarding interest rate guidance, alongside the current risks that trade wars pose. Remember, the risk premium attach to the meeting relatively tame with break-evens at 60 pips, while large EURUSD option expiries at 1.17 and 1.1735-40 have also contained price action.

The first release of second quarter US GDP will shape the short-term future of the US dollar, especially if the latest round of rumors are confirmed. Early expectations of 4.3% q-o-q growth have been upgraded by the market to ‘high 4s’ with some bullish commentators even seeing the possibility of a ‘5 handle’ when the number is released at 12:30 GMT. Rumors need to be taken with a pinch of salt – and are not the basis of any trade – but the prevailing market seems to be pricing in a strong GDP release for now.

Recently released data show that inflation has picked-up marginally in the EU, while growth has slipped back for the second quarter in a row. EU headline inflation rose to 2.1%, from 2.0%, but the ECB’s favoured indicator, core inflation rose to 1.1% from 1.0%, still way below the ECB’s below but close to 2% level. Growth slowed in the block to 0.3% in Q2, down from 0.4%.
$$$$
EURUSD had been moving gently higher ahead of the data releases and is currently consolidating as it nears the July high at 1.1791. Breaking above here may prove difficult, especially if Fed Chair Jerome Powell gives a bullish update on the US economy at tomorrow’s FOMC meeting, while US non-farm payrolls lie ahead on Friday. The US jobs market remains extremely strong and little is likely to have changed due to the overall strength of the US economy.
$$$$
EURUSD currently trades around 1.17250 and above its 20- and 50-day moving average. The RSI indicator is neutral but pointing slightly higher and there are minor resistance levels before the July high is hit. Above here the June 14 high at 1.1852 is the next target. On the downside, the two moving averages between 1.1682 and 1.1692 provide minor support.

Eurozone GDP grew by a weaker 0.3% quarter/quarter in Q2, down from 0.4%, and the year/year growth rate slipped to 2.1% from 2.5%.
$$$$
Meanwhile, Eurozone inflation rose to 2.1% in July from 2.0% and the core rate also edged higher.

However, the data are unlikely to alter the outlook for Eurozone interest rates or move EURUSD out of its recent narrow trading range.

$$$$
Eurozone economic growth slipped in the second quarter of the year but continued to expand healthily while inflation in July edged up to 2.1% – higher than the European Central Bank’s target of “below but close to 2.0%”. However, the data leave expectations of stable Eurozone interest rates until at least the end of next Summer unchanged and the recent narrow trading range for EURUSD intact.
$$$$
Official statistics showed Eurozone GDP expanded by 0.3% quarter/quarter in Q2, below the previous 0.4%. The economy grew by 2.1% year/year, down from 2.5%. Headline inflation in July edged up to 2.1% from the previous 2.0%, the core rate nudged up to 1.1% in July from 0.9% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 8.3% in June after a downward revision of the May number.  
$$$$
The data showed economic growth was lower than analysts had expected while inflation was higher. However, they are broadly in line with ECB expectations and will therefore have no impact on the bank’s monetary policy. It intends to leave Eurozone interest rates unchanged at least “through the summer” of next year and the data releases contain nothing to prompt a sharp move in EURUSD either way.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
The Euro edged up on the stronger-than-expected inflation figures. Technically, EURUSD has now moved higher for four consecutive sessions and a break above resistance from the trendline connecting the recent lower highs is now possible. However, further resistance lies at the 1.1791 July 9 high, the 1.18 “round number” and the 1.1852 June 14 high so any appreciation is likely to be modest.

The latest IG Client Sentiment Indicator shows how retail are positioned in EURUSD and Gold, and how daily and weekly changes in sentiment can affect trading decisions.
$$$$
The DailyFX Q3 forecasts and analysis of USD, EUR and Gold are available to download here.
$$$$
The US dollar continues to press higher and is within touching distance of a new one-year high, supported by US Treasury yields and expectations of a better-than expected US jobs report. The dollar index (DXY) currently trades at 94.88, up a full point in the last four days. Today’s US non-farm payrolls report is expected to show 192,000 new jobs created, pushing the unemployment rate down to 3.9% from 4.0%, confirming the ongoing strength of the US economy. Wednesday’s FOMC meeting underscored a third 0.25% rate hike this year, in September, with heightened expectations of another hike in December.
$$$$
EURUSD continues to weaken and now nears the 1.1500 level that has provided support over the last two months. As monetary policy continues to diverge between the two economies – the ECB is not expected to hike rates until Q3 2019 – the pair have come under increasing selling pressure and now eye the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.1448. The 1.1500 level may provide support again, if central banks are defending this level, with a break lower likely to attract the ire of Washington. US President Donald Trump has already complained about the lowly level of the EUR and how it affects the balance of trade between the two and he is likely to become vocal again if EURUSD falls further.
$$$$
Gold continues to falter in the face of a strong US dollar complex and a weaker Chinese Yuan. With US yields rising, the non-interest bearing precious metal continues to lose its appeal with recent risk-off bounces sold into. Gold is also at the mercy of US-China trade tensions with the Chinese Yuan continuing to weaken as US trade tariffs are imposed. The correlation between the two assets remains firm and is seen as one of the primary drivers of gold’s weakness. USDCNH is currently quoted at 6.8940, its highest level since May 2017 and up from 6.2500 in March this year.

Gold is now sitting on important support just under $1,205/oz. and a break lower would see $1,194/oz. the March 2017 low come into play ahead of the January 2017 low at $1,180/oz. The precious metal is in oversold territory according to the RSI indicator which may act as a short-term buffer against further losses.

US Dollar Holds Near Highs as Confidence Climbs in July	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/07/31/US-Dollar-Holds-Near-Highs-as-Confidence-Climbs-in-July.html	1533052800	"
Consumer confidence rose in July after a disappointing drop in June

The survey surpassed expectations and climbed a point versus the previous month
$$$$
A more detailed look at the survey result highlights some caveats in the positive reading

$$$$
Consumer confidence surpassed expectations in July, coming in at 127.4, beating June’s figure of 126.4 and this month’s forecast of 126.5. The drop last month was attributed to lower income prospects. Consumer spending is a vitally important aspect of US economic activity so July’s seemingly strong survey performance is a lifeline to US equities that have been troubled after the recent FANG portfolio unraveling. 
$$$$
A more detailed look at the survey results reveals that, although the headline reading was strong, few respondents believe the economy will growth at a faster pace moving forward. Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, said “consumers assessment of present-day conditions improved, suggesting that economic growth is still strong. However, while expectations continue to reflect optimism in the short-term economic outlook, back-to-back declines suggest consumers do not foresee growth accelerating.”
$$$$
Consumers’ optimism about short-term economic outlook also waned in July. The percentage of consumers that anticipate business conditions will improve over the next six months increased +2.4% to 23.1% but those who expect business conditions will worsen also rose +1.5% to 10.8%. The more detailed results show signs that consumers believe the economy may be nearing its peak, as conditions are rosy now and optimism in the long-term wanes.
$$$$
While the result offers some fleeting optimism for recently troubled US equities, it also offers insight on the US consumer’s perception of the ongoing trade wars. Last month’s drop was a worrying sign that trade wars had a tangible impact on economic outlook and the economy may begin to unravel. This month’s increase shows consumers have not necessarily felt substantial impacts but see potential for the trade wars to constrict or contribute to a slowing economy in the future.

Although the confidence survey is an important economic data piece, a barrage of important upcoming data dominates investor focus. Tuesday saw a Japanese rate decision, Canadian GDP, and Mexican GDP. The FOMC decides interest rates Wednesday and the Bank of England is due for the same Thursday. Still, US equities and the dollar basket were slightly in the green Tuesday morning, likely due to a few factors like the BoJ decision and Canadian GDP coupled with the confidence data.

$$$$
EURUSD goes into today’s FOMC meeting on the backfoot with recent rallies providing better selling levels for traders. Today’s meeting is expected to be reasonably quiet – the next 0.25% interest rate hike is fully priced in for the September meeting – but Fed Chair Powell’s press statement is likely to confirm the strength of the US economy. Powell may also confirm the central bank’s independence after US President Trump’s recent comments on the strength of the US dollar, removing any political hurdles from the central bank’s hiking intentions.
$$$$
US 2-year Treasuries currently offer 2.675%, and this yield will track interest rates higher, while the Eurozone equivalent, the German 2-year, continues to trade with a negative yield (-0.57%). This differential, and the German curve is negative all the way out to 6-years, will continue to see money flow from the euro to the US dollar, weakening the single block’s currency.
$$$$
EURUSD touched a one-week high of 1.1746 on Tuesday before quickly retreating below 1.1700. The pair now sit on the 20- and 50-day moving average and may fall back further if the FOMC releases a hawkish statement. The upside for EURUSD remains at 1.1791, the July 9 high, while the November 7 swing low at 1.1554 remains a medium-term target for bears. The double-low just above 1.1500 should provide solid support for the pair.

EURUSD saw a close below 1.1575, which now opens up a potential move towards the 2018 low (1.1508). Alongside this, the 12-day momentum remains negative, consequently reinforcing the bearish sentiment in the pair, while trend signals are also moving lower. Bids at 1.1550 has curbed further selling in the spot rate, however, as the price continues to dip, demand for Euro puts (protection against further declines) have increased.

Another set of soft German factory orders with the figures missing expectations for the fifth time in the past six months. The headline reading fell sharply lower by 4%, expectations were for a slight dip of -0.4%, while this also marks the largest fall since January 2017. However, these figures are for June which is slightly outdated given that this was prior to Trump’s and Juncker’s agreement to refrain from imposing auto tariffs.
$$$$
Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence rose for the second consecutive month to 14.7 in August, which came ahead of expectations of 13.5 as concerns of a full-blown trade war between the US and EU had eased. Largely this was due to the aforementioned agreement between Trump and Juncker, consequently, the sub-index measuring future expectations had improved, however, does remain in negative territory. Sentix stated that Germany, whose auto industry has the most to lose from US auto tariffs, is the biggest winner from easing trade tension, which has been reflected in the index for Germany, showing a bounce back in August to hit the highest level since May.

Continuing concerns about a US-China trade war are continuing to boost the US Dollar while weakening the Euro. That has sent the EURUSD price close to important support levels and, if they break, further losses would be highly likely.
$$$$
On the USD side of the equation, the US Dollar is seen increasingly as a safe haven thanks to a relatively strong US economy and a belief that tariffs would narrow the US trade deficit. Meanwhile, worries that Italy will boost its spending and some poor industrial output data from Germany continue to weigh on the Euro.
$$$$
Chart by IG
$$$$
Budget talks began in Rome last week and an increase in spending would potentially increase Italy’s deficit next year. Meanwhile, German industrial production fell by 0.9% month/month in June, according to the latest data – a sharper fall than the 0.5% predicted and in stark contrast to the downwardly revised 2.4% increase recorded the month before.
$$$$
From a technical perspective, the EURUSD chart above shows the pair has already broken through support from a triangle pattern but has stabilized Tuesday after six successive daily falls. Even so, it remains close to support from the May 29 low at 1.1510 and the June 21 low at 1.1508.
$$$$
A drop through those levels could take EURUSD back to levels last seen in July 2017, suggesting further steep losses are now possible.

Crude oil: Initial spike higher in Brent crude after OPEC source reports noted that OPEC is considering boosting production by around 300k-600k bpd, which is a lot less than the previously touted 1-1.5mln bpd. Additionally, given that the market has roughly priced in around 500-700k bpd increase, this has been perceived as relatively good news.

USD: Subdued trading in the greenback, which has pulled back from the 95.00 handle as major pairs begin to stabilise. Tit-for-tat trade spat continues to escalate between the US and China with the latter announcing retaliatory tariffs on the US, while they are also considering tariffs on oil.

Oil - US Crude: Data shows 66.5% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.99 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since May 25 when Oil - US Crude traded near 7160.7; price has moved 10.3% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 2.3% lower than yesterday and 0.9% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 23.8% lower than yesterday and 10.8% lower from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests Oil - US Crude prices may continue to fall. Traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger Oil - US Crude-bearish contrarian trading bias.

Eurozone Current Accounts Falls Significantly
$$$$
A muted reaction seen in EUR/USD and the DAX after the Eurozone’s current account for April fell to EUR 28.4bln from EUR 32.0bln a year earlier. This was due to the EUR 21bln surplus in goods and EUR 9.6bln in services, while the NSA adjusted reason fell to EUR 26.2bln from 40.6bln.

President Draghi Cautious on Outlook
$$$$
Following last week’s surprise announcement by the ECB, attention had been placed on today’s comments from President Draghi. In the speech, the ECB President stated that inflation and growth had been returning to objective, while also stating that the central bank will be patient in determining timing of first rate hike. Reminder, the ECB noted that rates will remain low until at least summer 2019, implying that the first “live” meeting would be September 2019. Additionally, the President highlighted that uncertainty surrounding the growth outlook had recently increased amid the escalation of trade wars, as such risks to growth are tilted to the downside. 
$$$$
Following these relatively cautious remarks from President Draghi, EURUSD has slipped through 1.16 and is now back towards the mid-1.15. Eyes now on the June low at 1.1510, whereby a break could see a run in for 1.1448.

JPY: Global markets tumbled with Chinese markets slumping near 4% and US equity futures falling over 1% after reports that the Trump administration were looking at fresh tariffs on Chinese exports valued at $200bln. This is on top of the threat made by Trump to impose 10% levy on China if they do not change practices. As such, as China and the US move closer towards a full-blown trade war, the JPY has been supported by safe-haven flows, notably gaining against the commodity currencies (AUD, NZD, CAD). 
$$$$
AUD: Given its large exposure to China, the Australian Dollar has come in middle of the trade spat between the US and China. Consequently, AUDUSD has fallen to 13-month lows with room for further losses as fears rise over Chinese retaliation. Elsewhere, the latest RBA minutes omitted guidance in regard to interest rates (previously had rates likely to go up rather than down), which suggests that increased trade uncertainty has entered the thinking among RBA rate setters.
$$$$
GBP: Yesterday saw the House of Lords deliver another defeat for PM May by voting in favour of parliament having a “meaningful vote” on a final Brexit deal. As such, PM May faces another vote in the House of Commons, consequently Brexit uncertainty remains high, which has kept the Pound pressured and now trading at 7-month lows. Fears mount for Theresa May as Tory rebels have warned that they could collapse the government if they disagree with the final outcome of the withdrawal talks.
$$$$
EUR: Following last week’s surprise announcement by the ECB, attention had been placed on today’s comments from President Draghi. In his speech, Draghi stated that inflation and growth had been returning to objective, while also stating that the central bank will be patient in determining timing of first rate hike. However, highlighted concerns over growth outlook amid rising downside risks from escalating trade wars. Consequently, EURUSD slipped through 1.16 and moved towards support at 1.1550. Eyes on the June low at 1.1510, whereby a break could see a run in on 1.1448.

AUDUSD: Data shows 67.6% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.08 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since Jun 05 when AUDUSD traded near 0.7619; price has moved 3.2% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 2.8% lower than yesterday and 16.4% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 1.7% lower than yesterday and 31.8% lower from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests AUDUSD prices may continue to fall. Positioning is less net-long than yesterday but more net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed AUDUSD trading bias.

ECB Announces QE Taper, However, EUR Falls on Rate Path Guidance	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/06/14/ECB-Announces-QE-Taper-However-EUR-Falls-on-Rate-Path-Guidance.html	1528978260	"
ECB to reduce QE purchases by EUR 15bln and exit by December
$$$$
ECB does not see rate rise until at least summer 2019
"	"
EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
ECB surprised markets by announcing decision to reduce the pace of QE purchases after September 2018 by EUR 15bln until the end of December 2018, by which net purchase will come to an end. This immediately saw the Euro rise to session highs. However, the gains were short lived after the ECB provided guidance in regard to its interest rate guidance, whereby the council judged that current rates will remain at current levels at least until Summer of 2019, which in turn saw EURUSD fall to session lows. Following the comment regarding rate hikes, money markets now price in a 40% chance of a 10bps hike by July, down from 70%.
$$$$
(ECB Statement Comparison from Prior Month)
$$$$
Following the monetary policy statement, this has largely taken the excitement out of President Draghi’s press conference. However, markets will await the council’s thoughts on the latest developments regarding the Trump administrations protectionist policies. At the beginning of the month, the US had imposed aluminium and steel tariffs on the EU, while also threatening auto tariffs, subsequently the EU announced that they will impose retaliatory tariffs from July 1st. As such, the recent escalation in trade wars could see the ECB suggest that risks related to the threat of increased protectionism have risen, potentially dampening there view on the growth outlook by noting that risks are “tilting to the downside” as opposed to broadly balanced.
$$$$
Current ECB Staff Projections (Mar 18)
$$$$
Inflation: 1.4% in 2018, 1.4% in 2019, 1.7% in 2020
$$$$
Growth: 2.4% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019, 1.7% in 2020
$$$$
ECB staff are likely to upgrade their view on inflation amid the surge in oil prices, which have risen over 20% since the last set of staff projections on the back of escalating geopolitical tensions. Another supporting factor for inflation will be the weaker Euro, in which the trade weighted index has fallen 2.4%. As a reminder, most recent inflation figures jumped to 1.9%, while the core reading remained rather low at 1.1%.
$$$$
In regard to growth forecasts, there is a possibility that these could be downgraded given the fact that recent data, most notably from Germany has continued to slow hinting at growing underlying weakness in the Eurozone economy. Last week saw the release of Eurozone GDP, which confirmed that Q1 growth had slowed to 2.5% on the year.

EUR: ECB surprised markets by announcing decision to reduce the pace of QE purchases after September 2018 by EUR 15bln until the end of December 2018, by which net purchase will come to an end. However, the Euro plunged following its rate path guidance, whereby the council judged that current rates will remain at current levels at least until Summer of 2019. Consequently, money markets have repriced a 10bps rate hike for September 2019.
$$$$
GBP: Another sizeable rebound in UK retail sales for May, which saw all metrics printed ahead of expectations, subsequently, this took GBP too session highs against its major counterparts. The headline monthly reading surged 1.3% (Exp. 0.5%), while there was also an increase in the core reading of 1.3% (Exp. 0.3%). The ONS stated that the bounce in retail sales was due to good weather, alongside the royal wedding celebrations resulting in a boost on food and household goods. However, the gains in the Pound had been hampered following the rise in the USD, which had been led by EUR selling post ECB. GBPUSD now toying with the 1.33 handle.
$$$$
USD: The greenback outperforms, largely as a by-product of the sell-off in the Euro, as such, the USD is back above 94.00. Another factor supporting the USD has been the better than expected retail sales and jobless claims data.

Rift over immigration policy could spell the end for Merkel
$$$$
Snap election likely to weigh on the Euro
"	"
EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
End for Merkel? 
$$$$
If there is one thing that had been made apparent by yesterday’s 2 big figure plunge in the Euro yesterday. Is that nothing lasts forever, whether that’s ECB QE, or Chancellor Merkel’s leadership. Amidst the surprise announcement by the ECB to detail its QE exit and alter its rate guidance, a report had surfaced that the German coalition that took 6 months to form could be on the brink of collapse with Bavarian sister party CSU threatening to break away due to different opinions over immigration policy.
$$$$
Given the upcoming Bavarian regional election in October, which has the right wing AfD party gaining in the polls, threatening the CSU’s majority, the latter has favoured a tough immigration policy stance. Bavarian Interior Minister Seeehofer had put forward a plan to turn back some refugees at the German border, however, this plan had been refused by Chancellor Merkel, while the SPD party had warned that the coalition would if Merkel had accepted the CSU’s demands. 
$$$$
Last Minute Compromise
$$$$
Chancellor Merkel will most likely have discussions over the weekend to find a solution and reach a last-minute compromise with the CSU. Although, failure to do so in which the CSU deem any immigration solution as too soft, the Interior Minister could utilise his ministerial powers impose new and tougher immigrations rules. This would not only leave Merkel’s majority vulnerable but risk a split away between the CDU and CSU, raising the threat of a no-confidence vote for Merkel or snap elections, which would likely see the Euro pressured.
$$$$

A test for a break through the June low at 1.1510 has increased, which will likely allow for a run in on 1.1448, which marks the 50% retracement of the rise from 1.0340-1.2556. Resistance is situated at 1.1600-20, with further targets at 1.1650.
$$$$
Further Unwind of Long EUR Positioning 
$$$$
According to the latest CFTC data heading into June 5th, net Euro longs are still relatively high, valued at $13bln. This suggests that there is further room for a larger unwind of long positions, increasing the risk of a greater fall in the Euro, which could be exacerbated as EURUSD presses for lower levels.

Trade worries sapped risk appetite to some extent

Japanese trade data actually came in quite strongly
"	"
Join our analysts for live coverage of all major Asia Pacific economic data at the DailyFX Webinars
$$$$
Asian stocks were mostly lower as a new week kicked off, with Monday’s action dominated by new worries about global trade.
$$$$
Last week the US Administration said it would impose a 25% tariff on more than 800 Chinese goods, with Beijing respoinding in kind. Although the total possible increase is not large in the scheme of overall US/China dealings, renewed tensions on the subject did risk appetite no good.
$$$$
Crude oil prices fell too zas China threatened new barriers to US imports.
$$$$
The session’s actual trade data, which came from Japan, was quite strong. Exports surged at their highest annualized pace for four months in May, official numbers showed, but the overall trade gap yawned more widely than expected thanks to a sharper import rise.  
$$$$
Still, that was nowhere near enough to pull stock markets out of the doldrums. The Nikkei 225 was down 0.9% in the Tokyo afternoon. Most other bourses were in the red too, with the exception of the ASX 200 which managed to stay up thanks to strength in the banking sector. 
$$$$
The US Dollar remained close to seven-month peaks against its major traded rivals, with prognoses for more interest rate hikes keeping support firm. EUR/USD remained under pressure although the lows of late May seem to be providing quite solid support. 
$$$$
Trade fears were modestly good for gold, which inched up by 0.3% or so through the Asian session.
$$$$
There’s not much left on Monday’s data schedule, with only the US house price index from the National Association of Home Builders likely to attract much market attention.

Asian markets traded mixed Monday with international trade tensions still keeping risk appetite clipped. Oil prices slipped as investors tried to factor in an expected production increase.
$$$$
On Sunday US President Donald Trump used Twitter to ask all countries to lower trade barriers or face new retaliation. Last week he directed the US Trade Representative to identify US$200 billion of Chinese goods with a view to imposing an additional 10% tariff. 
$$$$
On the same day the People’s Bank of China cut the amount of cash some banks must keep on hand, which newswires said was a stimulus move aimed at spurring lending to smaller firms. Sure enough, the Shanghai Composite was the only notable regional gainer, adding 0.2% as its close approached. The Nikkei 225 was down 0.4%, meanwhile, with the Hang Seng, Kospi and ASX 200 all lower too, if not by much.
$$$$
The Euro remained quite buoyant thanks to stronger Eurozone economic data last week and investor perception that Italy’s politics may not be the threat to stability they might have been. This strength kept the US Dollar away from 11-year highs against a basket of its most widely traded rivals. Turkey’s lira gained the country’s President Tayyip Erdogan claimed electoral victory for his ruling AK Party.

EUR/USD seems to have quite solid support at the lows of late May, which also contained bears last week.

Gold prices got an early lift from trade worries, but that faded as the session wore on. Crude oil prices tried to factor in an output increase agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC producers on Friday, with the Brent benchmark falling sharply before pulling back.

President Trump Threatens to Impose Tariffs on EU Autos
"	"
EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
The Euro and DAX saw a subdued reaction following a relatively mixed German IFO report. The business climate in Germany dropped to 101.8 in June from 102.3 as expected. However, the current assessment had fallen more than expected, having slipped to 105.1 from 106.1, while the expectations index had printed higher than forecast at 98.6 rather than 98. The IFO cited concerns over US trade war and weaker global economic growth as reasons for declining business confidence. 
$$$$
The backdrop of escalating trade tensions continues to plague investor sentiment. On Friday, President Trump threatened to impose a 20% tariff on all European cars coming into the US if trade barriers and tariffs on the US from EU are not 'broken down and removed'. In response to this, European equities came under pressure, most notably German auto names. Additionally, Trump tweeted over the weekend that all countries should remove tariffs or be met with reciprocity by the US, as such, with the US showing no signs that it will back down, investor morale could continue to come under pressure over the forthcoming months.

JPY:Global trade tensions continue to linger with the US drawing up plans to limit Chinese investment in US technology firms, while the EU has promised to respond to any auto tariffs. Subsequently, trade worries have heightened risk aversion and led to a bid in the relative safety of the Japanese Yen. USDJPY back towards the mid-109s, however remains well within the recent range. 
$$$$
EUR: The Euro is better supported despite this morning despite a relatively mixed IFO report, which showed German business confidence deteriorating amid rising uncertainty surrounding trade wars and slowing global growth. Additionally, the latest CFTC data showed huge speculative selling in the wake of the ECB’s announcement to delay the timing of the first-rate hike, which in turn suggests that EURUSD may have based out around 1.1510.

JPY: Yet again the uncertainty surrounding trade wars continues to see the JPY outperform across the board on safe haven flow amid the fallout seen in equity markets, whereby the Shanghai Composite fell into bear market territory overnight (falling 20% from January peak). However, USDJPY remains well within its recent range, while 1-month risk reversals continue to suggest that further declines are in store for the pair. Latest from President Trump is that the US are finalising studies with regards to EU auto tariffs, which in turn has kept the pressure on EURJPY, slipping below 1.28.
$$$$
GBP: Markets were given a first glimpse of the bias of incoming Bank of England rate setter Jonathan Haskel, who will replace one of the most hawkish members on the committee, Ian McCafferty, when his term expires in August. One thing that was made apparent is the wide difference in views with Haskel leaning on the dovish side, having stated that there may be more slack in the economy, weakening the case for an interest rate rise. This was in stark contrast to McCafferty who stated that the BoE should not dally in raising rates. As such, with greater focus on the incoming rate setter, GBPUSD fell to its lows of the days, falling from 1.3276 from 1.3206. However, GBPUSD had since recovered to the mid-1.32s, given the 1.1bln option expiry sitting at 1.3250.
$$$$
EUR: Recent gain in momentum for Euro sceptic Lega, following municipal election victories over the weekend have continued to pressure BTPs, which in turn has led to continued widening in German-Italian bond spreads.

Eurozone Regains Momentum Despite Stagnant Manufacturing Sector
$$$$
Eurozone PMI data for June had been generally mixed with the service reading rising to a 4-month high at 55, above forecasts, while manufacturing remained stagnant at an 18-month low of 55, which was in line with expectations as increased trade war tariff tensions continued to weigh on the manufacturing sentiment. Overall, the composite reading printed higher than expectations suggesting that the Eurozone is regaining some momentum, with the survey suggesting that GDP will rise by 0.5% in Q2. 
$$$$
The Euro is notably firmer following generally positive figures out of France and Germany, which indicates that growth continues to remain firm, despite the recent deterioration on the trade front amid rising trade tensions as both China and the US show no signs of backing down from a full-blown trade war. Additionally, news of faster expansion alongside rising price pressures will be welcomed by the ECB after it signalled last week that its ultra-loose monetary policy will end this year with rates rising in 2019.

Italian assets retreat as Italy appoints Eurosceptics
$$$$
EURUSD falls to the lowest level since July 2017
"	"
EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
EURUSD fell to its lowest level since July 2017 at 1.1508 as Italian assets came under pressure with BTPs and the FTSE MIB falling to session lows. This followed reports that two Eurosceptic members had been appointed to the finance committee, subsequently raising concerns over the possible anti-EU stance that could unfold in Italy.
$$$$
Eurosceptic Bagnai had been named as head of the Italian Senate Finance Committee, while Borghi, who is one of the top economic advisers for League leader Salvini had been chosen to head the budget committee in the Lower House of Parliament. Though it is not clear is not clear how prominent roles will be in regard to dictating economic matters, their critical views on the Euro is very clear. As such, this has prompted to flight away from Italian assets.

Major Headlines
$$$$
USD: Yet again the USD has rejected a firm move above 95.50, which has seen the greenback push back towards support at 95.05-15. Reminder month-end rebalancing could play a key role in USD selling over the next two days as indicated by investment bank models. Additionally, final GDP data for Q1 from the US fell below expectations at 2% (Exp. 2.2%), subsequently leading to a further retracement of earlier gains.
$$$$
EUR: The Euro slightly firmer as option related buying above 1.15 barrier options continue to support EURUSD, despite German inflation easing slightly with the headline rate falling 0.1ppt to 2.1%. Typical month-end buying sees EURGBP break above 0.8840, however, a close above could see the cross on course for the 0.8900 handle.
$$$$
GBP: Among the worst performing currencies today as Sterling faces a couple potentially tricky days ahead with Brexit on the menu at the EU Summit. No resolution is expected but a further round of negative talk from the EU will increase fears of a no-deal Brexit which neither side really wants. Focus for GBPUSD is 1.3025-1.3030, which coincides with the October 2017 low and rising GBP flash crash trendline support.
$$$$
CAD: BoC Governor Poloz provides mixed signals over a July rate hike with the governor fretting over the effects of US tariffs and tighter mortgage rules, however, noted that the economy is at a situation where it will warrant higher interest rates. Initially, USDCAD had been somewhat undecisive, although grinded lower as rate hikes bets for July increased, which sits at 63% from 54%.
$$$$
NZD: Overnight, the RBNZ announced its latest monetary policy decision, in which the central bank had been had kept the Official Cash Rate at 1.75%, while also providing a more dovish report than previously, which in turn has led to a fresh wave of NZD selling. The central bank signalled yet again that the next move in rates could be up or down, as such, this highlights the fact that the RBNZ are a long way from considering raising rates with only the end of 2019 seen as a possibility. Subsequently, this prompted NZDUSD to break through the November 2017 low (0.6780).

GBPUSD: Data shows 72.1% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.58 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since Apr 20 when GBPUSD traded near 1.41803; price has moved 7.7% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 2.5% higher than yesterday and 0.6% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 6.5% lower than yesterday and 1.9% higher from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests GBPUSD prices may continue to fall.

Euro Surges Higher As EU Strikes Eleventh Hour Immigration Deal	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/06/29/Euro-Surges-Higher-On-Last-Minute-EU-Immigration-Deal-Reports.html	1530241380	"
The Euro gained sharply on Friday
$$$$
European Council President Donald Tusk announced a late night deal on immigration
$$$$
Markets had feared damaging deadlock
"	"
Find out what the #1 mistake that traders make is and how you can fix it! 
$$$$
The Euro rose sharply on Friday on news that European Union leaders had reached a deal at their Brussels summit on the highly charged issue of immigration into the bloc.
$$$$
The Italians had sought further negotiation on the subject but President of the European Council and summit chair Donald Tusk said that an accommodation had been possible- after ten hours of talks- in the early hours of Friday European time.
$$$$
“EU28 leaders have agreed on (summit) conclusions, including on migration,” Tusk said, according to Reuters. Details of remained scant, but the fact that a deal of any sort had been struck was enough to unleash Euro bulls. Markets knew that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the summit could be a defining moment for the EU before the fact. 
$$$$
The single currency gained, notably against the US Dollar, Japanese Yen and UK Pound. 
$$$$
On its broader, daily chart the EUR/USD remains well within the downtrend which has dominated for much of 2018 as interest-rate differentials remain so firmly in the US Dollar’s favour. 
$$$$
However, the single currency does appear to have found quite firm support at the lows of May 30, which have also stymied June’s bearish forays to date.

Asian shares edge higher as EU Summit immigration deal boosts risk trends
$$$$
Ahead, USD, EUR and CAD could be volatile as they face key economic data
$$$$
Can EUR/USD hang on to its gains as it approaches near-term resistance?
"	"
Find out what retail traders’ Euro buy and sell decisions say about the coming price trend!
$$$$
Following a rosy day on Wall Street, most Asian benchmark indexes followed suit and were cautiously higher by Friday afternoon trade. Though most of the gains were quite sudden as news crossed the wires that European Union leaders reached a deal at their Brussels Summit on the issue of immigration. Sentiment improved as some political uncertainty was arguably reduced.
$$$$
The measures EU leaders agreed on lessened concerns that there would be a standoff between Italy and the bloc. Earlier this month, the two anti-establishment parties (Five Star Movement, Northern League) came together to form a government. Their proposed reforms, if enacted, would violate some EU laws. Today’s agreement probably cooled some of those fears, perhaps paving the way to more agreements down the road.  
$$$$
Looking at equities, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose about 0.13%. More aggressive were in China where the Shanghai Composite and CSI 300 climbed about 1.20% and 1.48% respectively. In Australia, the ASX 200 was little changed but favoring slight gains, industrials and health care were holding it down. South Korea’s KOSPI was up a little over a quarter of a percentage point.
$$$$
On the FX side of things, the Euro was the clear champion with EUR/USD rising more than 0.4 percent following the news from Brussels. On the 15-minute chart, the pair had its largest move (up or down) since the ECB rate decision a couple of weeks ago. Not surprisingly, the US Dollar was down across the board, likely reflecting heightened demand for its European counterpart.
$$$$
Sentiment-linked currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars pushed higher. Though the latter has quite the distance to go to make up for its heavy losses in recent days. The anti-risk Japanese Yen plunged as a boost in risk appetite sunk the need for safety, it was the worst performing major at the time of this writing. USD/JPY was heading for a close above 2017 resistance. Such an outcome could pave the way for a resumption of its uptrend after impressive employment data.
$$$$
Friday’s remaining economic calendar docket is loaded with key event risk. Most notably, we will start with Eurozone CPI data. During Thursday’s European session, we had softer German inflation data which may be a preview for a worse-than-expected outcome on the aggregate figures. In addition, data out of the regional bloc has been tending to outperform for most of this year so far. Such an outcome could see the Euro give up some of its gains from the Asia session as ECB 2019 rate hike bets get pushed out further.
$$$$
Then, we will get April’s Canadian GDP data. Growth is expected to slow to 2.5% y/y from 2.9%. Keep in mind, last week we also had a worse-than-expected local CPI outcome. Nevertheless, the Canadian Dollar held on to its gains as Bank of Canada’s Governor Stepen Poloz kept the door open to rate hikes despite rising concerns on trade war worries. With that in mind, perhaps CAD losses could be tamed in the bigger picture.
$$$$
BACKGROUND: A Brief History of Trade Wars, 1900-Present
$$$$
Finally and simultaneously, we will also get the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. PCE Core is anticipated to rise 1.9% y/y in May from 1.8% in April. Such a result may bolster Fed hawkish expectations and boost the US Dollar.
$$$$
Friday’s Loaded Docket: (All Times Listed in GMT)
$$$$
On a daily chart, EUR/USD is still struggling to get below the May horizontal support and the news from Brussels has sent it rising back to the November/December 2017 lows. Simultaneously, positive RSI divergence warns that the pair is losing downside momentum and the pair may rise in the near-term. A close above resistance opens the door for a test of the June 14th high at 1.1852. On the other hand, a close below support exposes the 50% midpoint of the Fibonacci extension at 1.1400.

EUR: The Euro is among the outperforming currencies today following reports that the EU struck an eleventh-hour dealon the highly charged issue of immigration into the bloc. Alongside this, month end selling in the USD has also helped push the Euro higher with the pair hovering around 1.1650. Additionally, Eurozone inflation rose to its highest level in over year, rising 2% following another surge in energy prices, however, core inflation continues to remain subdued, with the reading printing at 1%.
$$$$
GBP: UK Q1 GDP saw a surprise revision higher to 0.2% from 0.1%, as such, this helped lift the Pound, which now firmly sits above 1.31. However, despite the better than expected monthly reading which will likely grab the headlines, annual GDP growth at 1.2% still represents the weakest reading since Q2 2012, while business investment saw its largest fall since Q4 2016, having dipped 0.4%.
$$$$
CAD: The Loonie firmer this morning after Canada GDP unexpectedly grew by 0.1% against expectations for no change. Given that on Wednesday, BoC Governor Poloz stated that economic data would decide the next move in interest rates, market pricing jumped to 83% from 67% for a July rate hike.

Italian Consumer and Business Confidence Stabilises Amid Reduced Political Uncertainty
$$$$
French Consumer Confidence Falls to Lowest in 2yrs
"	"
EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
The Euro and FTSE MIB were largely unmoved following the release of the latest Italian consumer and business confidence surveys. With regard to the consumer survey, the confidence climate in June rose from 113.9 to 116.2. This followed the improvement in economic and future components, which offset the decline in the personal and current components. In terms of business confidence, this dipped to 106.9 from 107.6, however, the overall business composite reading had stabilised. It is likely that the recovery in both consumer and business confidence had stemmed from the reduced uncertainty in regard to Italian politics, given that the league and 5-star party had agreed to form a coalition.
$$$$

$$$$
In contrast, French consumer confidence missed expectations to fall to its lowest level since August 2016 at 97, below the expected 100. As a reminder, earlier this month INSEE forecast slower French economic growth for the rest of 2018 amid a earlier strength in the Euro, coupled with higher oil prices and uncertainty over US protectionist measures.

EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
The Euro remains under pressure as the USD regains its allure, alongside this, a slew of regional German inflation figures have shown both the M/M and Y/Y readings ease off a touch, which is in line with the consensus for the national report (1200GMT). Consequently, this gives the ECB doves reason to remain cautious with regard to its first interest rate hike, which is not seen until at least after summer 2019.

$$$$
Eurozone economic sentiment fell in June to 112.3, as managers and consumers in the construction sector became more downbeat amid the rising uncertainty surrounding trade wars, however the decline was less than expected. The fall in sentiment readings reaffirm a cooling of the Eurozone economy in Q2 18, which is at a time when the ECB are looking to exit their expansive monetary policy. As a reminder, the latest staff projections from the ECB showed a downgrade to 2018 growth to 2.1% from 2.4%.

EURUSD potentially set for making a test of the near-term base at 1.1510, a break below would suggest that the downtrend remains intact with 1.1448 the next support level of significance. On the upside, key resistance is seen at 1.1720.

US Manufacturing Boasts Surprise Growth in June as Trade Wars Rage	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/07/02/US-Manufacturing-Boasts-Surprise-Growth-in-June-as-Trade-Wars-Rage.html	1530561720	"

Stay up to date on important economic data with our Economic Calendar.
$$$$
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released the monthly reading of US manufacturing activity to surprise markets on Monday as trade wars seemingly have yet to restrict production. Growth in manufacturing sector activity saw the index climb to 60.2 in June following the previous month’s 58.7. The new figure also surpassed forecasts, with economists expecting a step down to 58.4 amid trade pressures with China, Canada and the EU among others. The unexpected uptick was partly due to an acceleration in production growth, rising to 62.3 from 61.5 previously.
$$$$
The ISM index matched the second highest level the index has seen in the current period of economic expanison that began in 2009. Contributing to the increase were new orders and employment, with the index for new orders boasting a reading of 63.5 and employment 56. Although they contributed gains for the month, both the indexes saw a slight slip from May when they read 63.7 and 56.3 respectively. On the other hand, supplier deliveries rose to a 14-year high, suggesting more bottlenecks are developing, likely due to tariffs. As some US corporations have already realized, tariffs may begin to hamper their production abilities in the US with rising material costs as the EU, Canada, and China have now levied counter-tariffs on the United States.
$$$$
Moving over to markets, the ISM manufacturing index generated significant moves in a littany of currency pairs as the US Dollar basket mounted a steep climb at the time the data was released. Similarly, the euro suffered losses as did the pound. Since the release, however, the pound has attempted a modest recovery, climbing up from previous lows. Moving forward, the ISM manufacturing index will continue to be an important metric in the ongoing trade wars as bottlenecks develop and respondents express further concern on the impact of tariffs in their businesses.

$$$$
EUR: Political uncertainty remains prominent for the EU amid reports that CSU Leader Seehofer offered his resignation following a disagreement over Chancellor Merkel’s migration deal. Alongside this, trade war woes continue to weigh on sentiment with the EU threatening to impose retaliatory tariffs on the US if they pursue EU auto tariffs. Consequently, the Euro is on the back foot to begin the week, with EURUSD pulling further away from the 1.17 handle to trade at lows of 1.1630, eyes will be on key support at 1.1500-10.
$$$$
USD: Despite the risk off sentiment, the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc are slightly offered against the greenback. The USD showing traits as a safe haven currency given its reserve status, while higher interest rates from the FOMC has helped attract inflows into the USD. However, the greenback looks to be moving towards key resistance zone from 95.30-50, which has continued to curb further advances in the USD. If indeed there is another rejection at these levels, this would likely imply support at 1.1500 for EURUSD and 1.3000 for GBPUSD. 
$$$$
GBP: Largely lower amid the broad gains in the US Dollar, a slight beat on the UK manufacturing PMI provided an initial boost, however gains were short-lived with factory output slowing from the 5-month highs last month, which in turn suggests that manufacturing remained subdued for Q2. Not exactly the rebound that BoE members had been looking, sticking with the BoE, Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe provided some downbeat comments in regard to the UK economy amid global developments surrounding trade wars and the rising probability of a China credit crisis. A sizeable 1.1bln option expiry at 1.3095-1.3100 likely to garner attention.
$$$$
CNY/CNH: Against the backdrop of trade wars, more and more attention has been placed on the Chinese Yuan, which continues to weaken and has shown no signs of abating. Since June 15th where the Trump administration stated that $234 worth of Chinese goods will be subject to tariffs from July 6th, the offshore Yuan (CNH) has fallen at a rapid rate with the CNH weaker by over 3.7% against the US Dollar.
$$$$
Crude Oil: Over the weekend, President Trump stated that he spoke with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on boosting oil production by as much as 2mln bbls, adding that prices were too high which the Saudi King is said to have agreed with. In reaction to this, oil prices after softer this morning. However, losses have been stemmed amid reports that Libya’s NOC declared a force majeure at a number of key ports, leading to an outage of over 800k bpd.

Euro prices rose as some ECB members fret over late-2019 rate hike bets

Upcoming commentary from Yves Mersch could reveal more details next
$$$$
EUR/USD’s recent consolidation is met with fading downside momentum
"	"
We just released our 3Q forecasts for currencies like the Euro in the DailyFX Trading Guides page
$$$$
During illiquid trading conditions given the US Independence Day holiday, the Euro suddenly spiked higher against its major counterparts. Around 16:20 GMT, reports crossed the wires that some ECB members are seeing a rate hike around the end of 2019 as ‘too late’. In the aftermath of this development, EUR/USD managed to nearly pare most of its losses when the US Dollar gained as expected.
$$$$
To give a little bit of context, back in June the European Central Banksent the Euro tumbling despite confirmation of its QE programme coming to an end by the end of this year. What really drove the currency lower was President Mario Draghi’s patience in terms of waiting to raise rates thereafter. This was reiterated at an ECB Forum in Portugal on June 19th.
$$$$
With that said, any signs to the contrary are likely to have bullish impacts on the Euro. In fact, German front-end government bond yields rose as today’s update crossed the wires. This indicates increasing hawkish ECB monetary policy expectations. Some ECB members were also said today to be a bit uneasy that September/October 2019 policy bets are underpriced.
$$$$
Going forward, it will be imperative to follow commentary from the European Central Bank to gauge how much follow through there could be had here. In fact, on Thursday we will get commentary from ECB Executive Board Member Yves Mersch. Signs that he favors policy tightening sooner can add fuel to the Euro’s rise and vice versa.

However, do keep in mind that these bets can be quickly struck down by President Mario Draghi. Also back in June, he said that the end to their bond buying program is subject to incoming economic data. With that in mind, it seems that their timing of a rate hike will largely depend on that. Keep in mind that generally speaking, economic data out of the Eurozone is still tending to underperform relative to economists’ expectations.
$$$$
Looking at a daily chart, EUR/USD continues consolidating in a familiar range since last month’s ECB monetary policy announcement. It is confined by resistance which is around 1.1718 (November/December 2017 lows) and support at 1.1507 which is also the 38.2% Fibonacci extension. 
$$$$
However, downside momentum is ebbing as indicated by RSI which shows positive divergence. This warns that there may be a push higher ahead if not more consolidation. As always, a break above resistance will require confirmation to argue that the pair may reverse its downtrend which began in mid-April.
$$$$
Immediately above resistance though is a range where the pair was unable to push above in early June. The outer boundary of this area is the June 14th high at 1.1852. Getting above that opens the door for a lasting reversal. Meanwhile, a break below support exposes the 50% midpoint of the extension at 1.1400.

USD: The USD is on the backfoot ahead of tomorrow’s tariff implementation on $34bln worth of Chinese goods, retaliation from China will likely follow, which continues to weigh on the greenback. Elsewhere, ahead of the NFP report, today ADP Employment Change figure underwhelmed expectations for a 4th consecutive month, subsequently adding to the pressure on the USD.
$$$$
GBP: Upbeat comments from BoE Governor Carney has lifted the Pound this morning, alongside market expectations for an August rate hike, which now sits at 63%. Given the recent improvement in macro data, this has led the Governor to believe that weakness in Q1 had been due to temporary weather-related effects, as such, Carney has signalled his desire to raise rates in August. However, data remains key and will ultimately cement whether the BoE will hike in August. But for, GBPUSD has based out at around 1.3050, next move is for 1.3350-1.34 to be tested provided Brexit uncertainties ease, which in the event it does not eyes will be on 1.3100.
$$$$
EUR: Initial resistance above 1.17 has been breached with the Euro finding support after ECB source reports that some members view a rate at the end of 2019 as too late, which is not anything new given that the ECB have suggested that the first live meeting is September 2019. Nonetheless, EURUSD has found some support with the pair eyeing next resistance at 1.1725.
$$$$
Auto Names: Global auto names are trading at their best levels, with the DAX among the notable beneficiaries given that Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen make up 12.5% of the index. This came after reports that the US proposed to suspend EU auto tariff threats if levies are reduced. As such, a potential of trade concessions has improved risk sentiment.

GBPUSD: Retail trader data shows 69.2% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 2.24 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since Apr 20 when GBPUSD traded near 1.4131; price has moved 6.3% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 1.0% higher than yesterday and 5.2% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 4.6% higher than yesterday and 6.5% higher from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests GBPUSD prices may continue to fall. Yet traders are less net-long than yesterday and compared with last week. Recent changes in sentiment warn that the current GBPUSD price trend may soon reverse higher despite the fact traders remain net-long.

EUR: Among the underperforming currencies amid the bounce back in the USD index.

$$$$
Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 12.1 in July, ending a run of five consecutive monthly declines, which also came ahead of expectations of 8.2. However, despite the bounce in morale, Sentix stated that escalating trade tensions with the US risks depressing sentiment again, adding that if President Trump targets the European car industry, the trade spat could lead to a more pronounced slowdown in economic sentiment. Elsewhere, the Sentix survey for Germany saw investor morale fall from 16.2 from 18.5, marking the 6th consecutive decline, reaching its lowest level since February 2016.
$$$$
Germany’s trade surplus widened more than expected at EUR 20.3bln, against consensus for EUR 20bln. This had largely been due to the better than expected exports reading at 1.8% (Exp. 0.75%). Consequently, this signals a boost for the German economy after the recent setback in prior months.

Euro Unfazed by Inflation Amid Political Uncertainty
$$$$
Given the boost in German and French inflation, in which both nations saw headline inflation above the ECB’s 2% goal. Markets had been gearing up for a better than expected Eurozone inflation print, in turn, EURUSD saw a muted reaction upon release. Focus for Euro traders is on the political developments in Spain and Italy, with the latter the dominant factor for financial markets. As it stands, both the 5 Star and League are attempting to form a governing coalition, avoiding a snap-election, which has provided a lift for the Euro as Italian bond yields plunge with the 2yr back below 1% as recent polls have suggested greater support for populist parties, most notably the League. In Spain, a no-confidence motion over PM Rajoy is currently being debated in which a successful no-confidence vote could see snap-elections called in Spain, providing an additional headache for the ECB and potentially keeping the Euro subdued.

$$$$
The Euro has been smashed down to five-month lows against the US Dollar, with investors looking nervously to the probable confirmation of a euroskeptic government in Italy on Monday.
$$$$
The rightist League party and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement have agreed a governing accord which would cut taxes and accelerate welfare spending. This could hack at the heart of the Stability and Growth Pact- the chief document underpinning fiscal responsibility within the Eurozone in the absence of full political union. Coalition members have also been vocal in the past in their opposition to the Euro, although that rhetoric seems to have cooled somewhat in recent days. There are strong doubts that any move to leave the single currency - or even to edge away from it- would get past the Presiden't constitutional veto.
$$$$
President Sergio Matterella will be asked to formally approve their government later, although its spending plans are already under heavy fire from across Europe. French Economy Minister Brune Le Maire warned over the weekend that the stability of the Eurozone will be at steady if Rome does not keep to its commitments. Meanwhile in Germany Alexander Dobrindt- a senior member of the Bavarian sister party to Angela Merkel’s conservatives- has said that Germany will not foot the bill for Italy’s new spending plans. 
$$$$
The re-erruption of Eurozone cohesion as a market concern after a long period of dormancy has come at a poor time for the European economy. Softer economic data were already undermining the euro’s early-year strength, and bosting the Dollar. Bond spreads between Italy and Germany have also widened sharply- indicating markets’ increased worries about Italian economic risk. 
$$$$
This story is likely to play out for some time and keep EUR/USD under further pressure.
$$$$
The single currency has been caught in an accelerating downtrend against the US Dollar since late April on its daily chart. The fall involved has just taken it down through the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of the rise up from November 2017’s lows to the highs of this year. 
$$$$
If Euro bulls can’t regain that level (1.1789), then full retracedment at 1.1553 will remain in focus.

Muted EURUSD Response to Larger Trade Surplus	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/05/18/Muted-EURUSD-Response-to-Larger-Trade-Surplus.html	1526636220	"

Falling imports and exports suggest trade tensions are holding back global activity.

EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
The Euro and the Dax saw a muted reaction following the release of the latest Eurozone trade data. The trade surplus widened to EUR 26.9bln from EUR 18.9bln in February, slightly narrower than the EUR 28.5bln a year ago, as Eurozone imports and exports declined by 2.5% and 2.9% respectively. Subsequently, this adds to the evidence that trade tensions may be reining in global business activity, which had also been noted by the WTO recently who stated that trade tensions may be starting to hold back global trade.
$$$$
Overnight, reports had noted that China had offered the US a trade agreement worth the demanded USD 200bln on more purchases of US exports (current US deficit with China is roughly USD 350bln). However, this had later been denied by the Chinese Foreign Ministry who noted that talks are still ongoing. While it has not been made apparent that there has been a significant amount of progress in regard to a trade deal, this does suggest that both parties are looking for a resolution, which if successful could suggest that tariffs will not be imposed, providing good news for world trade and thus global growth.

EURUSD continues to remain anchored around 1.18 where there are 1.8bln worth of option expiries, as such, with little in the way of significant data releases, this could magnetise the pair. Euro bears continuing to look for a close below the 1.1790 76.4% Fibonacci Retracement (1.1553-1.2256), in turn the failure to close below could imply that EURUSD may be at risk of a short squeeze as Euro bulls find a base above 1.18. Widening US-German spreads and uncertainty over Italian politics to keep upside in the pair capped.

Major Headlines
$$$$
USD: The greenback continues to go from strength to strength, having taken another leg this morning albeit due to the slip in the Euro, which continues to feel the weight from the uncertainty over Italian politics. However, USD bulls may have to be somewhat cautious over the fact that the sharp rise in the greenback may run into exhaustion, given that every dip has run into fresh USD buying. Case remains the same that December highs at 94.22 remains the notable target in the short term. 
$$$$
CAD: The latest inflation data from Canada slowed slightly with the headline reading dropping 0.1ppt to 2.2%, which was below expectations of 2.3%. As such, USDCAD moved to fresh session highs which is now looking to making a break above 1.29, potentially reaching the weekly high at 1.2924. Given that inflation is falling towards the 2% target, this results in the necessity for the Bank of Canada to hike rates, as such, odds of a rate hike by the end of the month dropped from 43% to 37%. NAFTA continues to present itself as the major unknown for the Canadian Dollar outlook with uncertainty over when a deal can be finalised. 
$$$$
EUR: The League and 5 Star party have agreed on a government deal, which has continued to pressure Italian assets with BTP yields at the highest since November 2017 after rising over 7bps. One of the issues with the plan agreed by the populist parties is that it promises a major spending spree that will likely put Italy on a collision course with the EU. EURUSD back down to the mid-1.17s having given up the 1.18 handle, a close below 1.1790 could see the bearish trend remain intact.

$$$$
USD: The greenback beginning the week firmer, continuing to make a move towards the December highs at 94.22. This morning, the US Dollar pushed through 94.00, reaching a high of 94.06 with support from fading US-China tariff threats. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin stated that a trade war will be put on hold following a round of progressive talks in which China stated they would purchase more US exports. Subsequently, this saw a lift in risk sentiment, prompting safe-haven currency selling with USDJPY now consolidating above 111.
$$$$
GBP: Ahead of a busy week for GBP trader, the Pound is on the backfoot this morning with political uncertainty continuing to pressure the currency. UK newsflow remains GBP bearish with weekend reports noting that some Conservative MPs are said to be preparing for the possibility of a snap election in Autumn amid Brexit stalemate, while SNP’s Sturgeon pledged to restart her campaign for Scottish independence. As such, GBPUSD saw a brief dip below the 1.34 handle to trade at its lowest level in 5-months, which prompted a push higher in the FTSE 100, which typically has an inverse relationship, subsequently, the FTSE rose to a fresh record.
$$$$
AUD: The Australian Dollar received renewed support after the US and China appeared willing to hold back on initial trade tariffs having signalled that a possible trade deal may come to fruition. This development reduces the risk of softening global demand on the back of potentially lower industrial output from China and therefore supports the Australian Dollar given its large exposure to the nation. In turn, this reaffirms the view for AUDNZD to make a push towards the 1.10 handle having reclaimed 1.09, which is could lead to AUDUSD consolidating above 0.7500.
$$$$
EUR: The Euro remains subdued amid the political uncertainty in Italy, EURUSD briefly broke through 1.1750 to move towards lows of the day at 1.1717. However, heavy buying interest above 1.17 and a huge 1bln option expiry at 1.1760 have curbed any further losses in the pair for now.

EUR: The Euro found a bid this morning and is among today’s best performers in the G10 FX space following tightening chatter from ECB’s Villeroy who stated that the end of QE is nearing after which the ECB can give guidance on interest rate hikes. Subsequently, EURUSD made a run in on the 1.2000 handle where selling interest ahead keeps further upside capped for now. Additionally, the 200DMA at 1.2020 is also likely to act as resistance provided EURUSD pushes through 1.2000.

US President Donald Trump said in a Tweet Sunday that he was working with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to try and give Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE a way back into business. Washington had imposed a ban on US companies working with the Chinese name because it had shipped equipment to Iran. Trump’s tweet was seen as conciliatory ahead of a second round of trade talks, which looms this week and on which many hopes are pinned..

The Nikkei 225 ended up 0.6% with all major indexes in the green with the exception of the Kospi which was flat. The Hang Seng was a particular leader, rising 1.1% as its close neared.

The US Dollar is still feeling the pressure of last week’s weaker inflation numbers out of the US, with lower US Treasury yields also weighing. Malaysia’s Ringgit fell nearly 1% to a four-month low against the Dollar as local markets reopened following two days of post-election holidays last week. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad defeated the coalition government in last week’s elections. The local stock market manages gains, however.

EUR/USD has put in a modest bounce but has so far failed to get back above the levels traded in early May.

Oil prices slipped on a rise in US drilling rigs and on opposition in Europe and elsewhere to US sanctions against Iran. Gold prices gained, probably thanks to the US Dollar’s slip.

The economic calendar is quite bare for the remainder of Monday. European Central Bank board memebr Sabine Lautenschlager will speak in Copenhagen.

$$$$
Slowdown in Eurozone Growth Confirmed
$$$$
The Euro and DAX saw a largely muted reaction after a raft of Eurozone and German data points. Eurostat confirmed that Eurozone GDP for the first quarter of 2018 had slowed to 0.4% and 2.5%, which also follows the weaker than expected German growth figures reported earlier. Industrial production underperformed economic forecasts at 0.5% for March (Exp. 0.7%) and 3% for the year (Exp. 3.7%). 
$$$$
This data coincided with the German ZEW survey whereby the current conditions fell to 87.4 beating expectations of 86.2, while economic sentiment remained at -8.2. The survey noted that the US decision to quit Iran Nuclear deal and fears of further escalation of trade conflict with the US, alongside rising oil prices had a negative impact on expectations. 
$$$$
ECB Monetary Policy Path
$$$$
Today’s data points are unlikely to cause significant rethink in regard to the ECB’s current monetary policy path as inflation remains the biggest concern for the central bank. Yesterday, the usually dovish council member Villeroy caught the market off guard after stating that the ending of QE is nearing, while also hinting of a rate hike next year.

Major Headlines
$$$$
EUR: Investors have had a first glimpse of the concerns that a populist coalition poses with reports stating that the League and 5 Star Party are looking for a EUR 250bln debt relief from the ECB, while also looking at a mechanism by which nations can leave the Euro. Subsequently, the Euro has been the notable underperformer amid the near 20bps of widening between German and Italian yield spreads as Italy’s new government looks to be on a collision course with the EU. In turn, EURUSD made a break through 1.18 with the 1.17 now on the cards, while EURJPY is looking at making a move towards YTD lows (128.94).
$$$$
USD: As a by-product of the Euro weakness the initial losses in the greenback have been pared and as such the USD-index has posted fresh YTD highs. As markets continue to focus on rate differentials in favour of the USD, particularly after yesterday saw 10yr bond yields rise above taper tantrum highs the currency looks intent on making a move towards 94.00 before the highs seen in December at 94.22.
$$$$
JPY: Dampened risk sentiment has supported the JPY against its major counterparts. Overnight, North Korea seemingly had a change of heart after abruptly cancelling its South Korean summit and threatening to withdraw from the meeting President Trump is the demands from the US are one sided. USDJPY failing to garner significant buying interest above 110, while the losses in EURJPY are leading the advances in the JPY with pair trading with losses of 0.7%.

EURUSD: Data shows 55.4% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.24 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-long since Apr 30 when EURUSD traded near 1.208; price has moved 2.1% lower since then. The number of traders net-long is 1.4% higher than yesterday and 2.9% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 7.3% lower than yesterday and 1.5% higher from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests EURUSD prices may continue to fall. Traders are further net-long than yesterday and last week, and the combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a stronger EURUSD-bearish contrarian trading bias.

$$$$
The Eurozone faced an overall miss of important economic indicators on Wednesday with the drop in consumer confidence ending the day’s run. Although the indicator dipped only slightly from the previous month, it also fell well short of the forecasts for improvement made by economists. The consumer confidence survey for May was 0.2, a decline from 0.3 in April and short of the 0.5 forecast. The decline in confidence does not come as a complete surprise as multiple uncertainties continue to dampen the zone’s stability.
$$$$
The collection of European economies will continue to face significant risk in the coming weeks as the Italian people await the confirmation of their new government. Five Star movement’s leader, Luigi Di Maio and Matteo Salvini’s Northern League met with Italy’s President, Sergio Mattarella, and put forward Giuseppe Conte as their proposed candidate for prime minister, a law professor with no political experience. Both parties – and presumably their Prime Minister candidate – have supported an anti-EU and anti-Euro view during the campaign and after the election. As the political situation remains in flux, so too does the direction of Italy for the foreseeable future, an unsettling proposition for the EZ. Similarly, trade war fears continue to dampen the economic outlook as US President Donald Trump recently stoked trade tensions with China after positive progress was cited with China. Furthermore, some EU members continue to face risk of steel and aluminum tariffs. In a move to combat the tariffs, the EU submitted a list of “rebalancing” duties to the WTO, due to be imposed on the US if talks do not progress. See the recent history of trade wars in our infographic here.
$$$$
In addition to the general risks, the European docket had also issued a range of PMI figures for the Eurozone and its largest members – where nearly all of the readings slid from previous month’s updates and significantly disappointed. The Eurozone composite PMI – a proxy for GDP – printed at 54.1 in May versus the previous month’s and forecasts’ 55.1. As we look to markets, the slew of negative data has taken its toll on the Euro as well as the individual EU indices with widespread declines for the day. The Euro forfeited ground to the Dollar and Yen, but remained unchanged versus Sterling. The Euro Stoxx 50 dropped -1.45% as European economies digested the negative indicators and a general ‘risk averse’ sentiment across the global markets. Downward pressure will likely continue for the Eurozone economies into the foreseeable future until trade uncertainty and the Italian political situation are resolved.

GBP: The posted fresh 2018 lows this morning, testing 1.33 to the downside after softer than expected inflation figures, with the headline reading dipping to 2.4% vs. 2.5% expected. As such, a fresh wave of GBP selling had been seen, given that lower inflation reduces the necessity for the Bank of England to raise rates. Subsequently, this had been reflected in OIS markets (Overnight Index Swaps) whereby pricing for a rate hike in August fell to 33% from 40%, while bets for a November rate hike fell to 72%.
$$$$
EUR: Weak PMI surveys from the Eurozone and Germany has added further pressure to the Euro today, which continues to face uncertainty amid the concerns surrounding Italian politics. German PMI’s initiated the losses this morning in which private sector growth slowed to its lowest level in 20-months. The latest on the Italian political front, President Mattarella has asked the inexperienced Conte to try and form a government, worries are whether the EU critic Savona will be picked for the role of Economy Minister. Nevertheless, Euro selling looks set to continue as option pricing suggests further downside for EURUSD with demand for put options over calls at the highest since February.
$$$$
JPY: Risk off sentiment dominates the FX space, consequently supporting safe-havens, JPY and CHF, while the rout in Emerging Markets currencies continue as TRY plunge relents. Overnight comments from President Trump who expressed doubts over the NK-US summit, sparking the initial buying in the JPY with cross selling in EURJPY and GBPJPY throughout the European morning seeing gains extended.

As mentioned previously (click here) rising political tensions would see the Japanese Yen among the notable gainers. Uncertainty remains high in Italy, which is likely to be the case in the near term with Italy now heading towards another election later this year. As such, German-Italian spreads have widened considerably over the past week from 164bps to a high of 310bps, levels last seen during the Eurozone bond crisis. In effect this has weighed on the Euro and Italian assets, consequently pressuring EURJPY to the lowest level since June 2017.

According to IG Sentiment, EURJPY positioningsuggests that the pair may continue to fall, for more information of client positioning, click here

$$$$
Aside from Italy, Spain is beginning to enter the fray with the Spanish Parliament expected to vote on a no-confidence motion against PM Rajoy on Friday. A passing of no-confidence motion will likely see snap elections called in Spain which will add to the pressure on the Euro and force further buying interest in the JPY as investor sentiment will be unnerved by a wave of political uncertainty not only in Italy but also in Spain.

EURJPY Relative Strength Index is in oversold territory, the most since the French election, which could potentially hint a mild reversal. However, a step up in political uncertainty with Spain starting to cause concerns will likely to the selling persist.

The Nikkei 225 appears to be resuming its descent after breaking below a rising trend line

Find out what retail traders’ equities buy and sell decisions say about the coming price trend!
$$$$
At a glance, Asian shares were down by Wednesday afternoon trade as expected, echoing fears around Italy’s political environment. The country is heading for a new election that may become a referendum on its status in the European Union. However, most of the damage was done at market open when stocks gapped lower as they came online. If you take a closer look, shares were consolidating in the aftermath. This could have been due to a lack of updates on Italy this session so far which gave the markets some breathing room.
$$$$
In Japan, the Nikkei 225 was down as much as 1.44 percent and was on its way to close at its lowest in six weeks. China’s Shanghai Composite Index fell by 1.77% and headed for its lowest close in almost one year. The KOSPI declined about 1.68% and was on its way to finish at a March low. In Australia, the ASX 200 dropped more than 0.5% and appeared to be heading for a pronounced reversal as anticipated.
$$$$
A similar scenario was present in the FX spectrum. The anti-risk Japanese Yen started off this session sharply higher but pulled back some of its gains as the session dragged on. Meanwhile, the sentiment-linked Australian and New Zealand Dollars were also down before taking back some of their losses. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Rupiah awaited a delayed central bank rate decision where markets are anticipating a second hike in two weeks.
$$$$
Ahead, there are a handful of economic events to watch out for in addition to updates from Italy. The Canadian Dollar is bracing for intense volatility as it faces a BOC rate decision where recent developments could send USD/CAD higher. The Euro awaits German preliminary CPI estimates for May. Data out of the Eurozone aggregate has been tending to underperform relative to economists’ expectations this year so far. More of the same could send EUR/USD lower if softer German inflation, in addition to the uncertainty surrounding Italy, cause the ECB to rethink about cutting off its QE programme in September.
$$$$
On a daily chart, the Nikkei 225 closed below recent previous lows as it consolidated around the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 22,397. The index has now resumed its decent as it falls further away from a rising trend line that dates back to late-March. However, the Nikkei 225 is sitting right on top of the 38.2% level at 21,995. A break below that exposes the 50% midpoint at 21,670.

Major Headlines
$$$$
EUR: Relief rally is among the factors that have helped the Euro find a bid this morning and reclaim the 1.16 handle. Aside from this, German data has been somewhat encouraging with the unemployment rate falling to a record low of 5.1%, while inflation has also ticked up with the headline reading above the ECB’s 2% target at 2.2%. However, this is largely supported by the rise in energy prices other the past month, underlying inflation is of greater importance for the ECB. Although jitters over Italy have eased this morning, prompting a lift in the Euro, uncertainty remains with Italy likely heading for another election. Yesterday’s high at 1.1640 keeping a lid on gains for now.
$$$$
USD: The Dollar is losing some ground today and looking somewhat overextended above 94.20. Additionally, GDP figures underwhelmed expectations keeping the greenback offered, while trade war talk is starting to crank up again, following reports that the US is to go ahead of $50bln worth of import tariffs on China. As such, an escalation of this from China will likely suppress the greenback in the near-term.
$$$$
CAD: All eyes on the Bank of Canada meeting at 14:00GMT, where the central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged. Focus will be on the accompanying statement in which investors will be looking whether to re-price a summer rate hike (60% priced in for a July hike). Option market vols suggest break-evens are at 90pips.

Subsequently, USDTRY crashed through 4.50, reaching a low of 4.45.

Euro finds support as ECB look set to discuss QE exit at next week’s monetary policy meeting

$$$$
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
Yesterday, ECB source reports did the rounds, which highlighted that next week’s monetary policy decision (June 14th) should be considered as a ""live"" meeting to discuss QE exit. In the wake of the source report, this has prompted a slew of ECB speakers to confirm that a discussion over QE exit will be on the agenda. As it stands, bond purchases are at EUR 30bln/month and are set to expire at September 2018. It is likely that bond purchases will be extended to expire at the end of the year with a potential wind down of EUR 10bln/month or two EUR 15bln decreases.
$$$$
ECB’s Praet (Chief Economist) “Ending of APP (Asset Purchase Programme) will be up for discussion next week, signals showing the convergence of inflation towards our aim have been improving”. 
$$$$
ECB’s Weidmann “Market expectations of an end of APP by year end is plausible”
$$$$
ECB's Knot“Reasonable to announce end of QE soon, adding that inflation outlook is stable and less dependent on stimulus”
$$$$
ECB’s Dolenc (Not Voting Member) “Not worried about Eurozone slowdown, bigger concerns are trade wars and Italy”
$$$$
Source: Thomson Reuters (ECB Rate Hike Market Pricing)
$$$$
In response to the source report and following ECB comments, the Euro has pushed to better levels to consolidate above 1.17, reaching a high of 1.1770 while market pricing for a June-2019 rate hike is seen at 76% (up from 50%).
$$$$
As we look towards the ECB meeting on June 14th, EURUSD may see a continued wave of short covering, which would consequently see the pair to trend higher in the run up to next week, with the potential for a move above 1.1900. A break through 1.1775 would be needed to confirm last week’s corrective low at 1.1510. On the option market, 1-week EURUSD risk reversals have flipped with Euro calls now trading at premium to Euro puts, suggesting near-term gains are in store for EURUSD. However, downside risk remains as 1-month risk reversals continue to see Euro puts trading at a premium to Euro calls.

EURAUD, EURNZD: Both the Aussie and Kiwi have seen an impressive run against the Euro. Although, given the increased risk of a more hawkish ECB, this may trigger an unwind of the EURNZD and EURAUD selling, which could in turn see an end to the recent good run seen in NZD and AUD.
$$$$
EUR vs. commodity currencies: With reports that OPEC is set to boost oil production at the June 22nd meeting, commodity currencies (MXN, CAD, RUB) may come under fire and more so against the Euro, provided that the ECB delivers a more hawkish announcement than anticipated by market participants. CAD however, may be more resilient vs. EUR amid reports overnight that US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin had urged President Trump to exempt Canada from steel and aluminium tariffs.

This also follows on from Tuesday’s RBA meeting whereby the central bank had been upbeat over future economic growth (concerns remain over inflation).

AUD: The Australian Dollar is the clear outperformer this morning (biggest one-day gain since August 2017), with AUDUSD up over 1.1%. This has largely been down to the encouraging data overnight, with retails sales and business inventories beating expectations, while the broad risk-on tone has also underpinned gains. AUDUSD now firmly above 0.76, hitting the 0.7650 area with shorts squeezed, eyes on the RBA rate decision tonight, whereby the central bank will likely stick to its neutral tone.
$$$$
USD: Last week’s NFP report, which surprised to the upside, has eliminated any uncertainty over a Fed rate hike next week, which is near enough fully priced in. However, this is not relevant for the USD, what is relevant is the longer-term outlook of Fed policy, which has ticked up. Although, escalating trade tensions after the US imposed steel and aluminium tariffs on its closest allies (EU, Canada and Mexico) on Friday looks to have provided a top in the US Dollar and US bond yields. The USD is back below 94.00 helping its major counterparts gain ground as a trade war will likely weigh on the global economic outlook, resulting in increased downside risks to 3 additional Fed rate hikes this year. 
$$$$
EUR: The Euro is notably firmer, up 0.6% amid the broad-based weakness in the greenback. Signs of easing concerns over Italian politics with 10yr bond yields falling some 16.7bps has helped push the Euro higher. Confidence vote of new government scheduled later this week. Tighter yields between Bunds and BTPs have acted in a supportive manner for EURUSD, which in turn has seen the pair consolidate above 1.17.

GBP: Near-term GBP Direction may be impacted by the upcoming BoE speakers (Tenreyro, Cunliffe and Ramsden), which could help gauge the likelihood of an August rate rise, currently at 34%.Today’s Construction PMI alleviated concerns of a further deterioration in the UK economy with the reading above expectations at 52.5 (Exp. 52.0).

The United States’ announcement of metals tariffs on key trade partners this past Thursday has given developed world leaders something to debate at their forthcoming meet. The finance ministers and central bank heads of the Group of Seven (or G-7) met this past week in Canada to hold talks ahead of next week’s summit on June 8th and 9th in Quebec, Canada. The group’s members include Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US. Usually used as a forum for discussion on harmonized growth or the current state of the global economic system, finance ministers have expressed concern that this summit has been hijacked by unilateral trade action from the United States, causing some attendants to call the group “G-6 plus 1.” 
$$$$
The NAFTA member and close US ally fell victim to steel and aluminum tariffs justified due to supposed ‘national security concerns’ from the US starting Friday as the extended exemption period expired. In G-7 related talks, Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau acknowledged that trade has taken center stage at the meeting, saying “trade will be ‘first and foremost’ at the meetings.” Morneau went on to say: “We think it’s absurd that Canada is considered in any way a security risk, so that will be very clearly stated by me. I have every expectation that our other allies around the table will express the same sentiment.” In response to the metal tariffs, Canada said they will impose tariffs on $12.8 billion of US goods ranging from steel to whiskey and maple syrup. 
$$$$
USD/CAD 60-Minute Chart
$$$$
The EU members of the G-7 shared similar concern as they too fell under the steel and aluminum tariffs and could be further subject to rumored auto tariffs. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the tariffs on steel and aluminum from the EU, Mexico, and Canada are probably illegal. “The decision by the US government to unilaterally implement tariffs is wrong, and – from my point of view – also illegal. We have clear rules, which are determined at the international level, and this is a breach of those rules” he said to reporters ahead of his meeting with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  
$$$$
German Finance Minister Scholz had more to say on the subject, on which he found imposing tariffs as a tool particularly inflammatory. “We’ll always be ready to talk about reaching common agreements on trade policy but that’s only possible if unilaterally implemented tariffs are lifted,’’ Scholz said. “In the world we live in, it’s right to focus on a rules-based, free trade system. Protective tariffs don’t lead to prosperity, for [any] one.” The head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker also shared distaste for the subject of the meetings, citing issues like the Italian political situation as another topic of importance.

EUR/USD 60-Minute Chart

Ahead of the meetings this week, Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso engaged in bilateral discussion with Trade Secretary Mnunchin but a readout of the meeting from the Treasury Department made no mention of trade coming up in the discussion. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kurdo later said “of course protectionism is undesirable, I hope we can keep talking about it so that this doesn’t get out of hand.” Japan was not given extended exemption for steel and aluminum tariffs and thus has been subject to them since the original deadline a month prior.

The catalyst behind trade discussions, the United States’ will undoubtedly be in the hot-seat as other finance ministers and central bankers set the tone for the upcoming summit following the tariffs news. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held various bilateral talks on Thursday and Friday with finance ministers ahead of their official discussions. This weekend’s meeting was also the first official appearance by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at a G-7 summit. Central bank officials met separately from finance ministers Friday.

Trade Wars and Italian Politics Weigh on Investor Morale
$$$$
Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence declined for a 5th consecutive month to its lowest level since October 2016 to 9.3 in June, missing expectations of 18.4. The report stated that investor morale had been hit by concerns over 5 Star and League party taking power in Italy, alongside the US trade dispute. Investors assessment of current conditions and expectations reached the lowest level since August 2012.
$$$$
Elsewhere, the Sentix survey for Germany also saw a decline for the 5th month in a row, as the economy faces headwinds from US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports which took effect on Friday. Subsequently, this raises the risk of a potentially slowing of growth within the Eurozone. 
$$$$
Despite the soft report, EURUSD saw a muted reaction, with price action likely to be dictated by the latest developments surrounding US trade protectionist policies and the reduction in Italian risk premium. Elsewhere, according to the latest CFTC data, there is no longer a significant net-long Euro position as there was less than two months ago. Speculators held +93K contracts through the week ended May 29, a 39% decline from the all-time high set during the week ended April 17 (+151.5K contracts). As such, positioning should no longer be considered the significant negative factor it once was for the Euro.

Asian stocks were in broad retreat Friday afternoon as investors fretted about both emerging markets and some of their developed counterparts.
$$$$
The emerging market tensions centered on Brasil, where stocks and the real were under pressure Thursday. Recent opinion polls and a long, disruptive trucking strike has raised doubts that the government will be able to stick with its market friendly agenda. The developed market worries meanwhile involve the Group of 7 industrial democracies. They will meet this weekend in Quebec. A fractious get-together seems in prospect thanks to the confrontational trade approach being taken by US President Donald Trump.
$$$$
The Nikkei 225 was down 0.5% with all other bourses lower. Australia’s ASX 200 was a whisker lower, but the Shanghai Composite lose more than 1%.
$$$$
The US Dollar was a little weaker, largely thanks to a stronger Euro which came in turn on rising expectations that Eurozone monetary policy could yet be tightened. EUR/USD remains in its young uptrend channel, but the sharp falls of May 14 and 15 still look like tough work for the bulls.

The Group of Seven met Friday to discuss the themes laid out by the Canadian host, but the summit was likely focused on concerns over metal tariffs imposed by the United States. Leading up to the event, markets were focused on the G-7 currencies and economies while looking forward to any progress made in de-escalating trade tensions. Unfortunately, the first day of the summit may have been less than productive. French President Emanual Macron said he would not sign an official communique, a summary of the member’s agreements. Similarly, German Prime Minister Angela Merkel said “the lack of a communique would be a sign of honesty, showing we couldn’t agree.” Last year’s communique included the conclusions agreed upon by each member nation. Topics of note in the previous communique were: trade, the global economy, and inequality. The inability or unwillingness to produce an agreement highlights the depth of division between members at this year’s summit. 
$$$$
Although the summit appears gridlocked heading into the second day, slight progress could be championed by the group after day one. A suggestion from Germany’s Merkel to create a “shared assessment and dialogue” mechanism to discuss trade issues was received positively by other officials from the group. European Commission President Juncker said that he was personally ready to invest in it, while Canada’s Trudeau remarked he is holding out hope that progress can be made on the less controversial topics, but noted that President Trump would not be present for the second day of talks. President Trump told reporters he will leave Canada Saturday morning to fly to Singapore in preparation for the summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong-un on June 12th.
$$$$
Despite the gridlock at this year’s summit, any facetime that the leaders have provides them with an opportunity to de-escalate the spread oftrade warsexacerbated by the US metal tariffs imposed on June 1st. It could also turn into an opportunity for the United States’ peers to corroborate on a response. The two-day G-7 summit remains an important source of collaboration for developed economies and offers insight on other partnerships like NAFTA. The next opportunity for all these nations to convene and discuss trade is not immediately clear and the next G-7 meeting is not until 2019. In the meantime, trade officials will likely meet frequently for bilateral discussion. In similar fashion, President Trump has a meeting Saturday morning with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan has been subject to the metal tariffs since May 1st so trade will likely be an important topic. 
$$$$
Financial markets have been largely subdued in their response to the summit so far. Stocks produced small gains on Friday and the dollar was mixed, gaining against the euro and dropping against the yen and loonie. Moving forward, investors will be wary of any substantial information produced from the summit as tariffs remain in place and NAFTA remains in flux. If the uncertainty around global trade remains through the weekend – a likely outcome – the markets will have to shift gears and respond to important Federal Reserve and European Central Bank rate decisions Wednesday and Thursday respectively.

GBP: Inflation in the UK remained at 2.4% in May, below expectations of 2.5%. As such, this has led to a further unwind of BoE rate hike expectations with an August rate hike seen at 41%., down from 45%. Subsequently, GBP has remained under pressure to hover around the low 1.33s, while the UK parliament vote over the EU withdrawal bill will also likely keep a lid on GBP gains. EURGBP looking to make another retest towards 0.8830-40, break above could open up channel towards 0.89.
$$$$
USD: A relatively muted affair in FX markets ahead of the FOMC rate decision, in which the central bank is expected to deliver a 25bps hike to the Federal Fund Rate to 1.75-2%. However, the focus will be on the Fed Dot Plot projections where an upgrade to 4 2018 rate hikes could see the USD supported. A disappointment by the Fed to meet the high expectations of a hawkish hike would likely see a sharp reversal vs. the Euro and JPY.
$$$$
Reminder: DailyFX Chief Currency Strategist John Kicklighter will be covering the FOMC Meeting Live from 1745GMT.

EUR: The Euro is also in focus before the ECB meeting scheduled tomorrow. A slight short squeeze observed this morning with EURUSD back towards best levels of the day at 1.1770. However, price action has been somewhat muted ahead the key central bank risk events. EURUSD dismissed the another bearish report out of the Euro-Area with industrial production falling short of analyst expectations.

EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
The Euro and DAX saw a muted reaction despite another weak release of the latest ZEW survey. The data showed that the assessment of the economic sentiment in Germany fell sharply by -16.1 points, below the already bearish expectations of -14 points, subsequently tumbling to its lowest level since September 2012. The current economic situation fell by 6.8 points to 80.6 missing an expected reading of 85. As such, this shows that there is no clear sign of a reversal in the soft sentiment towards the Eurozone economy. ZEW noted that the impact of an escalation in a trade dispute with the US has continued to weigh on investor morale with outlook for the next 6 months significantly deteriorating.
$$$$
At the beginning of the month the US implemented aluminium and steel tariffs on the EU after both parties failed to agree on a workable solution towards the current trade deficit. As such, a tit-for-tat trade spat has broken out with the EU now preparing to implement retaliatory tariffs on the US from July 1st with the potential for further retaliation if the US impose auto tariffs. This has already had a impact with ZEW reporting worse than expected exports, production and industrial orders in April which has contributed to a more difficult outlook.

Major Headlines
$$$$
USD: Overnight, saw a historic summit take place between President Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un, whereby both leaders signed a landmark deal which will involve the denuclearisation of the Koran peninsula. The optimism over peace hasn’t filtered into a significant strength in the USD index with the basket slipping 0.1%, while initial USDJPY appreciation had run into sellers at 110.50. Markets seemingly looking through this summit with eyes on the Fed and ECB monetary policy decisions.
$$$$
Elsewhere, US CPI printed in-line with expectations across the board with a muted reaction seen in the USD, given that the FOMC meeting is 100% priced in for a hike, while the central bank has also noted that they will accept an inflation overshoot, consequently reducing odds of the Fed aggressively raising rates. 
$$$$
GBP: UK labour market remains robust with employment continuing to rise, while jobless claims slipped 7.7k, however this had been met with slowing wage growth components, subsequently providing a relatively mixed report. As such, GBP had held 1.34 against the USD for much of the morning, although uncertainty over the Brexit vote with parliament set to vote on the Brexit legislation has kept GBP offered. Rumours had surfaced that the government could lose the meaningful vote amendment if there is no concession. Focus on 1.3340 to the downside, whereby a break may exacerbate further GBP weakness.
$$$$
EUR: Gains in Euro capped for now following another bearish report out of Germany as the latest ZEW survey showed that German sentiment fell to its lowest level since September 2012 amid concerns over the escalating trade dispute with the US. EURUSD support comes in at 1.1725, while a breach above the 1.1840 resistance could open up the doors for 1.19.

IG Client Sentiment Index: USDJPY Chart of the Day
$$$$
USDJPY: Data shows 53.0% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders long to short at 1.13 to 1. The number of traders net-long is 3.9% higher than yesterday and 4.1% lower from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 3.1% lower than yesterday and 7.6% higher from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-long suggests USDJPY prices may continue to fall. Positioning is more net-long than yesterday but less net-long from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed USDJPY trading bias.

Asian Stocks Mixed As Investors Mull US Iran Deal Pullout	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/05/09/Asian-Stocks-Wednesday.html	1525849800	"

"	"
Find out what the #1 mistake that traders make is and how you can fix it! 
$$$$
Most Asian stock markets were slightly lower Wednesday as investors sold on news that US President Donald Trump was taking the US out of its former nuclear deal with Iran. The President delivered Tuesday on a pledge made in his election campaign to abandon the 2015 agreement and turn up the sanctions on Iran. 
$$$$
Crude oil prices climbed on the news although some commentators said that US sanctions against the country will have much less impact on the country’s oil exports than would a more international move against the agreement. 
$$$$
The Nikkei ended down 0.4% wit the Shanghai Composite and Kospi both lower as their closes approached. The ASX 200 and the Hang Seng both managed gains. 
$$$$
The US Dollar continued firm, especially against the wilting Euro which has been hit by patchy economic data and worries about new political splits in Italy. EUR/USD is in steep decline once more and back at lows not seen since December, 2017
$$$$
.
$$$$
 The Japanese Yen didn’t get much of a boost from the day’s only notable economic data, although it did show domestic wages rising at the fastest pace for two decades. Local monetary authorities will be hopeful that this will lead to more consumption and an inflation pickup, but some economists have cast doubt on the sustainability of wage growth.
$$$$
Gold prices were lower as the markets still price in multiple Federal Reserve interest rate hikes this year following a moderately hawkish performance Tuesday from Chair Jerome Powell.

It’s a pretty calm session for economic data in Europe and North America. Investors will get a look at US mortgage application levels and Canadian building permits but that’s about it.

EURUSD Fails to Find Support From Better Than Expected German Inflation	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/04/30/EURUSD-Fail-to-Find-Support-From-Better-Than-Expected-German-Inflation_1.html	1525092180	"
EURUSD saw a muted reaction following the release of the German CPI report.
$$$$
Euro continues to be pressured by the stronger USD, Italian elections may dent outlook.
"	"
Euro Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
German consumer price inflation stood at 1.6% year-on-year for April, which was slightly higher than expectations of 1.5%, while CPI month-on-month decelerated to 0% in April from 0.4% the previous month, printing above expectations of -0.1%. The better-than-expected inflation figures were primarily driven by the lift in prices for energy, rising by 1.2% from 0.5%, while food prices rose by 3.4% for April, up from 2.9% in March.
$$$$
Despite the higher than expected German inflation prints which should provide some encouragement for Euro bulls, EURUSD had been unfazed by the report, currently trading at session lows of 1.2075. The pair had broken through 1.2100 earlier today after weak inflation figures from Italy and Portugal, while German regional CPI had been somewhat mixed, alongside softer German retail sales data. Aside from the data, politics continues to provide a cause of concern with Italy potentially heading for another General Election in June and as such may dent the outlook in the near-term for the Euro.
$$$$
In Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation slowed to 1.5% from 1.6 % in March. However, inflation stood at 1.7% and 1.5% in Bavaria and Hesse respectively, while the Saxony state saw an uptick to 1.6% from 1.5%.
$$$$
Italy’s national consumer price index rose by 0.5% in April, down from 0.8% in March, which wasmainly blamed on the reversal of prices of regulated energy products and services related to transport. Portuguese Inflation also saw a sizeable drop to 0.4% from 0.7%, which in turn, increases the downside risks for Thursday’s preliminary inflation report from the Eurozone. 
$$$$
PRICE CHART 1: EURUSD 1-HOUR TIME FRAME (APRIL 4-30th)
$$$$
Overall the combination of German CPI with the soft inflation in the peripheral nations could potentially lead to a weaker flash reading in inflation from the Eurozone on Thursday. There may be rising expectations that the ECB could potentially delay their announcement in regard to their exit strategy from June (ECB staff projections are also released) to July or potentially further down the line amid the cooling off in Euro-Area growth, while inflation has still yet shown a convincing upward trend. A delay in the announcement past July will likely instigate a fresh wave of Euro selling, most notably against the USD as investors increase bets that the Fed may hike 3 more time this year.

USD: The Bullish momentum seen last week for the US Dollar has continued this morning, which comes ahead of a slew of major risk events, most notably the FOMC rate decision on Wednesday and NFP report on Friday. USD somewhat unfazed by today’s PCE figures which were largely in line with expectations, although the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation rising to a 17-month high will likely provide the Federal Reserve with some encouragement. The DXY looking to make a test for the 92.00 handle with the USD bulls largely finding support from the weaker EUR and GBP. Alongside this, month-end rebalancing models have signaled modest USD buying in the run up to the London FX fix. 
$$$$
GBP: Trend lower in GBPUSD shows no sign of abating amid rising political concerns after Home Secretary Amber Rudd resigned after claims that Rudd had misled parliament regarding immigration metrics. GBPUSD currently eying near-term support at 1.3712 (Mach 1st low), which also coincides with the March 2017 trendline support. Catalyst for 1.3700 will likely be on the upcoming UK PMI data, where investors will be looking to see if there is a rebound suggesting that recent data had indeed been largely impacted by temporary influences as opposed to weak underlying factors in the UK economy. 
$$$$
EUR: The Euro is among the worst performing G10 currencies this morning amid a raft of relatively subdued inflation figures with both Portuguese and Italian inflation printing below expectations. Germany headline CPI figure rose above expectations however the core metrics remained subdued, subsequently posing downside risks towards Thursday’s inflation report. Aside from the data front, Italy’s 5 Star Party leader has called on for a snap election as government talks to form a coalition flounder. EURUSD back below 1.2100, near-term support at last week’s low of 1.2055 before the 200DMA at 1.2050.

Sterling traders are likely to be on the sidelines ahead of the first look at UK Q1 GDP on Friday with market expectations for a further slowdown to 0.3%. While traders may have already factored this in, any beat to the downside will shake the British Pound lower. Expectations for a UK rate hike have dropped from around 85% to a current 50% and GBP may move further lower if the hike is delayed, probably until August.
$$$$
GBPUSD is also under downside pressure from a resurgent US dollar that is finding support from ever higher US Treasury yields. With the US economic cycle at a different stage than both the UK and the Euro-Zone, rate differentials will drive currency pairs involving the three major currencies.

How are Retail Traders Currently Positioned in GBPUSD and why does it matter?
$$$$
ECB President Mario Draghi will announce the latest central bank settings on Thursday – all expected to be unchanged – but it will be his comments on the ongoing bond buying program and his views on the strength of the economy and the ongoing lack of inflation that will draw interest. EURUSD looks under pressure at the moment and a combination of a weak EUR and a strong USD could drive the pair a lot lower.

EURUSD Pressured as Eurozone PMI Stays in Lower Gear	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/04/23/EURUSD-Pressured-as-Eurozone-PMI-Stays-in-Lower-Gear.html	1524474420	"
EURUSD slipped after Manufacturing PMI fell to 14-month low.
$$$$
Recent soft economic data may suggest increasing downside risks to upcoming ECB meeting.
"	"
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
Eurozone flash PMI readings for April showed that growth in the Euro-Area is indeed levelling off. The Manufacturing PMI fell to a 14-month low at 56, which missed expectations of 56.1, while the output index declined to a 17-month low at 55.8. In response to the PMI survey, EURUSD saw a slight move lower to 1.2250 from 1.2265, with the report likely to add to potential downside risks at the upcoming ECB monetary policy meeting on Thursday. 
$$$$
This PMI survey also adds to the slew of soft data points in Germany and the Eurozone in recent weeks, which expects Eurozone GDP to remain at 0.6% for Q2. The latest economic indicators had been acknowledged by President Draghi who stated on Friday Euro-Area growth cycle may have peaked. This has also been reflected in the Citi Economic Surprise Index which is hovering near its lowest levels since mid-2011, a time when the Eurozone was in the sovereign debt crisis. 
$$$$
The ECB have long desired for a lower Euro as evidenced by remarks in the latest monetary policy minutes release whereby the central bank highlighted potential dampening effect a rising Euro could have on inflation and growth. IHS Markit stated underlying growth has weakened, in part due to exports being hit by the stronger Euro. As such, given the fears of a firmer currency, Draghi and Co. may use Thursday’s meeting to strike a somewhat dovish tone in order to temper Euro gains.

Major Headlines
$$$$
GBP: Underperforming in the G10 FX space is the Pound, after UK Manufacturing PMI fell to the lowest level since Nov’16, further erasing bets of a Bank of England May rate hike. Given that UK data continues to deteriorate, this suggests that the UK economy is continuing to slow down amid weak underlying factors as opposed to previously touted temporary influences (adverse weather). In reaction to the soft report, GBPUSD made a break through the March low and the trendline support dating back from March 2017 at 1.3712 before falling below the 1.3700 handle. Support seen at 1.3659 (Sep 2017 high) and 1.3640 (200DMA). Looking ahead, tomorrow will see the release of the Construction PMI, followed by Service PMI on Thursday. 
$$$$
USD: Gains in the US Dollar shows no signs of running out of steam this morning having broken above 92.00, alongside this, trendline resistance from January 2017 had also been breached. DXY continuing to move with intent on hitting 92.50 as investors looks towards a more hawkish FOMC meeting tomorrow to provide the impetus. Further short squeeze on USDJPY gives scope for a potential move to 110 in the near term. 
$$$$
CAD: Canadian GDP figures printed ahead of expectations, consequently providing a boost for the Loonie with eyes now on comments by BoC Governor Poloz at 1745GMT which could prove to be a test for CAD buyers. Selling interest above 1.2900 has provided a top for USDCAD, as such, cautious comments from Poloz will likely see this level tested.
$$$$
EUR: Euro bears not giving up on a test of 1.2000, EURUSD currently trading at session lows of 1.2030, magnetized around the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.0340-1.2556 (2017 low-2018 high). On a macro front, President Trump extended tariff relief for the EU among other allies until June 1st, however, unless the EU and US can work out a permanent agreement, this will continue to provide uncertainty for the currency. 
$$$$
AUD: A relatively uneventful RBA meeting with the central bank sticking with its neutral stance on interest rates. Board comfortable in not moving interest rates anytime soon and remains assured that the next move will be a hike. RBA likely to stay unchanged for the remainder of this year, AUD under pressure but largely as a by-product of the strength in the DXY. Buying interest at 0.7500 in AUDUSD holding for now, similarly with NZDUSD at 0.7000.

Asian stocks managed gains for the most part on Tuesday with the markets looking hopefully to Washington DC where US President Donald Trump is expected to make a decision on a nuclear deal with Iran later in the session.
$$$$
Crude oil prices had risen earlier this week on worries that more sanctions could be applied, but they slipped back in the Asian session.

The day’s economic data saw Australian retail sales underwhelm. This knocked the Australian Dollar and robust trade news out of China wasn’t enough to put the spring back in its step. The numbers may have been seen as a little historic given that trade talks between the US and China are set to continue in Washington next week, with the threat of tit-for-tat tariffs still glowering.

The Nikkei 225 ended up 0.18% with most other regional bourses including the ASX 200 also in the green. The Kospi inched into the red as its close loomed on Seoul, with the morning session’s gain for tech apparently bringing out the profit takers.

EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
The selling in Euro has been evident since the end of April, which has recently posted fresh 2018 lows against the US Dollar (1.1884), dipping below the 1.19 handle. Much of this has largely been due to the recovery in the USD index, alongside the poor run of Eurozone data. The latter has unnerved investors as Euro-Area growth looks to have seemingly levelled off in 2018, most notably in Germany. This has been reflected in the Citi Surprise Index for the Eurozone, which currently hovers around the lowest level since the peak of the Eurozone Sovereign Debt Crisis.
$$$$
In terms of the USD recovery, recent gains have seen the greenback post fresh 2018 highs, breaking above 93.00 and looks intent on making a run for the December high at 94.22. In doing so, this will likely see EURUSD set up for a move south of 1.18, given that the pair had been trading around 1.1750-1.1790 in December.
$$$$
Source: Thomson Reuters (Citi Surprise Index for the Eurozone)
$$$$
The latest CTFC data has continued to show a change in sentiment for the currency with Euro longs heading for the exit from the recent record $23.4bln bullish bet. Net long positioning remains crowded at $18.07bln and as such this poses further downside risks for EURUSD, which could lead to greater chance of a further correction in the pair. 
$$$$
Source: Thomson Reuters (CFTC Euro Net Positioning)
$$$$
Given that inflation remains stubbornly low in the Euro-Area, this has posed a problem for the ECB who are currently looking at exiting their ultra-loose monetary policy. Alongside this, the recent weakness in economic indicators could potentially prompt a delay in the next policy shift announcement from the ECB (eyes on June/July meeting) with QE likely to be extended until the year-end, while expectations for a rate rise is not seen until mid-2019 at the very least.
$$$$
In terms of the Federal Reserve, their preferred measure of inflation (PCE), recently hit their 2% price target with the core measure just under at 1.9% (highest since Feb’17). As such, market participants have begun to raise bets (48.4% vs. Prev. 43.9%) that the Fed could raise rates another 3 times this year. Subsequently, the divergence in monetary policy between the Fed and ECB has led to a significant widening on US and German bond spreads, which has also weighed on EURUSD with losses set to resume.

Major Headlines
$$$$
USD: No stopping the bullish USD momentum which has yet again posted fresh 2018 highs and made a breach above the 93.00 handle. The greenback looks intent on making a move towards the December high situated at 94.22 with only 93.55 possibly offering some slight resistance in the near-term, which marks the 76.4% retracement of the 95.15 to 88.25 (October to February) fall. 
$$$$
EUR: The broader USD buying has attributed to the additional selling in the Euro, which has made a convincing move below 1.1900 with 1.1800 set to be tested. Latest CFTC data suggests that Euro longs could continue to bail, subsequently placing further pressure on the pair in the short-term. EURUSD failing to find any reprieve from the better than expected German Trade Balance and Industrial Production figures. Main risk event for the Euro will be Thursday’s CPI report, while comments from President Draghi at the end of the week will also likely garner attention.
$$$$
GBP: If the Bank of England needed another reason why now may not be the most appropriate time to raise rates, today’s Halifax UK House Price data provided it. The report noted that house prices saw their largely monthly decline since 2010, which alongside the USD strength has weighed on the Pound this morning. However, all eyes will be on the Bank of England’s Quarterly Inflation Report where GBP bulls will be hoping for a ‘hawkish hold’. 
$$$$
AUD: The Australian Dollar is notably weaker this morning following a rather lacklustre retail sales data in the Asian session, AUD weakness also taking its cue from the softer risk appetite led by lower oil prices. As such, the spot rate has made a firm break through 0.7500, buying interest seen at the low 0.74s. 
$$$$
Oil: All eyes on the oil market today as President Trump will announce his decision on the Iranian Nuclear Deal. A vocal critic of the agreement it is likely that President Trump will not certify the deal, however the focus will on whether the US will impose new sanctions on Iran that would curb crude oil exports. In the run up to the announcement, WTI crude futures have continued to pull back from 3 and half year highs.

IG Client Sentiment Index: Oil Chart of the Day
$$$$
Oil - US Crude: Data shows 41.0% of traders are net-long with the ratio of traders short to long at 1.44 to 1. In fact, traders have remained net-short since Apr 09 when Oil - US Crude traded near 6194.2; price has moved 13.1% higher since then. The number of traders net-long is 11.2% higher than yesterday and 4.2% higher from last week, while the number of traders net-short is 2.6% lower than yesterday and 7.0% higher from last week.
$$$$
We typically take a contrarian view to crowd sentiment, and the fact traders are net-short suggests Oil - US Crude prices may continue to rise. Positioning is less net-short than yesterday but more net-short from last week. The combination of current sentiment and recent changes gives us a further mixed Oil - US Crude trading bias.

Euro Sees Muted Response to Slowing Euro-Area Growth; Eyes on Inflation	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/05/02/Euro-Sees-Muted-Response-to-Slowing-Euro-Area-Growth-Eyes-on-Inflation.html	1525254300	"
EURUSD was unfazed by the slowing of Euro-Area GDP given that growth remains robust
$$$$
Focus will be on tomorrows inflation figures, which continues to remain subdued
"	"
EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
The Euro-Zone economy expanded by 2.5% Y/Y in the first quarter of 2018, a slight moderation from the prior quarter of 2.7%, nonetheless, growth remains robust, keep in mind that 2017 saw Euro-Area GDP growing at the fastest pace in 10yrs. GDP Q/Q was 0.4% in line with consensus and marginally lower from 0.6% previously, data also showed that the unemployment rate remained at the lowest level since December 2008 at 8.5%. As such, given that the figures printed in line with expectations, a muted reaction had been observed in the Euro, which trades around the 1.2000 level against the US Dollar. 
$$$$
With the GDP data not as worse as previously feared given the recent run of poor economic data, namely from Germany, this will undoubtfully keep the pressure on the ECB to stick with its plans to end its ultra-loose monetary policy later this year, potentially signalling its next policy shift midway through the year (June/July). This prospect should help the Euro find a base in the near term and potentially push higher in the medium term.
$$$$
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
Inflation in the bloc remains subdued, providing a headache for the ECB as a sustained adjustment towards the central bank’s target of “below but close to 2% goal” has yet to be seen. CPI figures released from Germany on Monday showed HICP inflation (most relevant metric for ECB interest rate deliberation) slow to 1.4% underperforming expectations of 1.5%, subsequently posing downside risks towards tomorrow’s Eurozone inflation report.

Major Headlines
$$$$
USD: Gains in the US Dollar have come to a halt this morning with the USD basket marginally lower as investors eye the FOMC meeting later. Expectations of a more hawkish Federal Reserve had underpinned the gains in the greenback and attributed to the recent recovery in the greenback. Today’s FOMC meeting may well largely be a non-event given that there will be no press conference from Powell or any dot plot projections, the Fed Funds Rate will almost definitely be left unchanged. As such, focus will be on the accompanying statement, however, USD bulls may be left a tad disappointed with the FOMC possibly only providing a slight hawkish tilt in language in regard to inflation given the building price pressures but the Fed will largely stick to a steady approach in order to not stoke too much market volatility. Elsewhere, the US ADP Employment report beat expectations at 204k (Exp. 200k), maintaining the picture of strong job growth with little sign of a slowdown. 
$$$$
EUR: Unsurprisingly, Euro-Area growth moderated slightly in the first quarter of 2018 to 2.5% from 2.7%. The Euro saw a muted reaction given that the figures had printed in line with expectations, additionally, growth remains robust and will unlikely deter the ECB from its exit strategy with the next policy shift potentially being announced at the June/July meeting. The Q/Q reading fell to 0.4%, which was below the ECB’s 0.7% forecast for Q1, which may in turn lead to a downgrade in the ECB growth staff projections (released at the June meeting). Tomorrow’s inflation report will be in focus, whereby risks are tilted to the downside after a slowing in Germany’s price growth seen at the beginning of the week. 1.2000 is keeping EURUSD price action rather static for now, to the downside near-term support is situated at 1.1915 (Jan 9th low), while on the topside, 1.2015 represents the 200DMA.
$$$$
GBP: Sterling has seen a mild reprieve this morning with support just under 1.3600, while also receiving a lift by the rise in UK Construction PMI, which printed ahead of expectations. More importantly, Construction PMI moved back into expansionary territory at 52.5 from the dire reading of 47 in March. However, this will unlikely be enough to provide stability for GBP, given last week’s poor Q1 growth report, which also came off the back of softer inflation. Alongside this, Brexit concerns have also been rising as the EU mounts the pressure on the UK to provide a workable solution for the Irish border. As such, this will likely keep a lid on Pound gains for now.
$$$$
NZD: The 0.7000 level continuing to keep NZDUSD supported for now, overnight saw the release of a relatively mixed jobs report. Wage growth remained sluggish at 0.3%, underwhelming expectations of 0.4%, while the unemployment rate showed a surprise fall to the lowest level since Q4 2008 at 4.4%. This ultimately emphasizes the case that the RBNZ will likely be on hold for the foreseeable future.

Major Headlines
$$$$
USD: The US Dollar rally has come to a halt after the FOMC slightly disappointed hawkish bets by maintaining their gradual approach. The statement had a slightly hawkish change in language, however indicated that they would be willing to let inflation overshoot target, subsequently signaling that there is not a case to raise rates aggressively. As such, the USD has slightly lost its recent momentum, focus will be on tomorrows NFP report. 
$$$$
Elsewhere, bilateral talks between the US and China have begun where both parties will be looking to strike a trade deal and avoid punitive tariff measures. Today’s trade figures will definitely lighten the mood, where the US trade deficit narrowed the most since the financial crisis with the deficit with China also narrowing.
$$$$
GBP: Today’s UK Service PMI rounded up what has been another disappointing week on the macro front for the UK. The release saw a slight pick up to 52.8 in April from the 20-month low of 51.7, however, underwhelmed expectations of 53.5, suggesting that the underlying economy remains fragile as opposed to weather induced weakness, in response GBPUSD fell through 1.3600 to revisit lows of 1.3555.
$$$$
IHS Markit reported that the PMI surveys collectively, pointed to Q2 GDP of 0.2% (second weakest since the Brexit vote). In turn, the most recent data points, coupled with cautious comments from BoE members indicate that a rate hike for May is completely off the table. Eyes on August QIR meeting where OIS markets are pricing in a 55% chance of a 25bps rate hike.
$$$$
EUR: Benign inflation in the Euro-Area continues to be a headache for the ECB, today’s reading saw the headline rate fall from 1.3% to 1.2%, while the core measure fell to 0.7% (lowest since March 2017). EURUSD saw a slight dip, however this had not been sustained given that the reading would have been somewhat priced in due to the recent subdued German, Spanish and Italian figures, while seasonal effects (Easter) had also been evident for the drag in inflation. However, this may well prompt the ECB to delay the next policy shift to July, while the current bond buying program will most likely be extended to the end of the year.

Eurozone PMI Confirms Cooling Growth; EURUSD Weakness Set to Continue	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2018/05/04/Eurozone-PMI-Confirms-Cooling-Growth-EURUSD-Weakness-Set-to-Continue.html	1525425180	"
Eurozone PMI confirms that the Euro-Area growth is slowing down
$$$$
EURUSD unfazed as this is unlikely to have large ramifications on ECB policy, focus on inflation
"	"
EURUSD Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
Eurozone final readings for April confirmed that Euro-Area growth has continued to slowdown. The Services PMI fell to 54.7 from the preliminary reading of 55, while the Composite PMI also saw a dip to 55.1 from 55.2. No significant response in the Euro given that these are final readings, however this is another bearish factor that will have to be addressed by the ECB in their next monetary policy meeting (June 14th). 
$$$$
However, the cooling of Euro-Area growth is from elevated levels, which had been noted by IHS Markit stating that the survey remains indicative of the Eurozone economy growing at a robust quarterly rate of approximately 0.5-0.6%. As such, this could be seen as temporary by the ECB who remain confident that Euro-Area growth is broad based and that risks are roughly balance, subsequently the slight easing of growth would unlikely stall the central banks process of withdrawing stimulus.
$$$$
Benign inflation in the Euro-Area continues to be a headache for the ECB, yesterday’s reading saw the headline rate fall from 1.3% to 1.2%, while the core measure fell to 0.7% (lowest since March 2017). Consequently, this may well prompt the ECB to delay the next policy shift to July from previously touted June, while the current bond buying program will most likely be extended to the end of the year. In turn, given that the ECB prefers a softer currency and with an uptrend in inflation yet to be seen, EURUSD weakness may be set to continue.

USD: In an immediate response to the NFP report, the USD index fell to session lows on the back of the weaker than expected headline print, while the wage data also underwhelmed expectations, which in turn led to a slight unwind of bets that there will be three additional rate hikes this year. However, the selling pressure in the USD was short-lived given that the softer readings had been met with a better than expected unemployment rate of 3.9% (Dec’2000 low) with today’s jobs report somewhat mixed. USD-index then continued to gain across the board as GBPUSD broke through its 200DMA, slipping through the 1.3500 handle, while EURUSD also edged towards session lows. First round of US-China bilateral talks concluded this morning, providing little in the way of inspiration for a boost in risk sentiment. 
$$$$
EUR: Eurozone PMI readings for April, confirmed that Euro-Area growth has continued to slowdown. Services PMI fell to 54.7 from the preliminary reading of 55, while the Composite PMI also saw a dip to 55.1 from 55.2. This also follows on from yesterday’s subdued inflation report where the core reading fell to a 1yr low, which may prompt the ECB to delay their announcement in the next shift in policy. As such, this is likely to keep the bearish EURUSD trend intact, while a material break below 1.1936 (61.8% retracement of 1.1553-1.2556 rise) would be needed to give weight to the downside bias and setting up scope for 1.1790.
$$$$
AUD: Overnight, the RBA released the latest Statement of Monetary Policy (SoMP) whereby the central bank raised their CPI forecast to reach 2% in Q2 18 from Q2 19, while revising higher their unemployment rate forecast to 5.5% from 5.25%. Additionally, they reiterated that higher interest rates will likely be appropriate at some point. In reaction to the statement, AUDUSD saw a slight bounce from the 0.7500, however this had been somewhat short-lived as the RBA signaled that a rate hike is unlikely to happen in the near-term. As it stands, market pricing for a rate hike is for Q1 19.

EUR Analysis and Talking Points
$$$$
See our Q2 EUR forecast to learn what will drive the currency through the quarter.
$$$$
Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence fell for a 4th consecutive month to its lowest level since February 2017 to 19.2 in May, missing expectations of 21. The report stated that investor morale had been hit by concerns over the introduction of punitive US tariffs, resulting in lower economic expectations, alongside a slightly weaker assessment of current conditions. 
$$$$
Elsewhere, the Sentix survey for Germany also saw a decline for the 4th month in a row, falling to the lowest level since September 2016. This somewhat mirrors the recent run of soft economic data points from Germany, which has led to a downgrade in forecasts for German growth prospects.
$$$$
However, despite the soft report, price action in the Euro will likely by dictated by Thursday’s US CPI report, while comments from Fed Chair Powell on Tuesday at 0715GMT will also garner attention for traders.

Earlier in the month, Senior Currency Strategist, Christopher Vecchio reportedthat the Canadian Dollar (USD/CAD) Mexican Peso (USD/MXN) outperformed the rest of the G10 currencies as Trump exempted Canada and Mexico from recently-imposed aluminum and steel tariffs. While trade tensions with the bordering nations may have eased threats from the European Union ramped up. Earlier this month, the EU retaliated by threatening to slap tariffs of their own on various U.S. products motorcycles, bourbon whiskey, and jeans. Trump, in his own response on Twitter, threatened to place tariff on European automobiles which “freely pour into the U.S.”
$$$$
Earlier today, we got news of an unofficial response out of the U.S. to the E.U. on a potential exemption to the metal tariffs. A Bloomberg reporter stated that the U.S. has stipulated five conditions that it would expect the European Union to meet. According to the reporter the conditions are:

The University of Michigan released its consumer sentiment report for March, furthering the swell in optimism the series has tracked. The survey rose to 102 from 99.7 the month previous and beat estimates for a modest slip to 99.3. This marks the highest reading from the index since 2004. The current conditions gauge measuring Americans’ perceptions of their finances rose to 122.8 from 114.9, a strong beat and the highest value since the metric began in 1946. Yet, not all the figures were roaring higher. The forward-looking index of consumer expectations dropped to 88.6 from 90 but remains positive year over year.
$$$$
The University of Michigan attributed the general enthusiasm to lower earning households feeling more optimistic about the economy. Respondents in the bottom third of household income revealed a 15.7 point net gain while the top third showed a drop of 7.3 points. While the bottom third of respondents felt quite positive, the top third indicated falling income and rising inflation expectations weighed on their outlook. Tariffs on imported steel and aluminum earned mentions in the survey according to the report, adding to the difference in future expectations and current sentiment. Tax cuts were also still showing through with the share of respondents citing income gains rising to a 50 year high. Split between the increases in consumer sentiment and economic conditions, a drop in consumer expectations paints a divided picture for next month’s report.
$$$$
Looking to the market’s response following the release of the statement, both the Dollar and US equities offered limited response – though the Greenback slipped slightly in early hours of trading and stocks advanced. There was little impact for EUR/USD as a heavy docket for next week – including the Fed rate decision, expected end to the tariff grace period and G20 meetings – pull the market’s focus further ahead. Should a trade war heat up and/or confidence in tax cuts turn into concerns over deficit building, the remarkable sentiment readings may eventually falter.

The US Dollar didn’t move far in relatively quiet foreign exchange markets. Its New Zealand rival got a modest boost from a mixed Australia and New Zealand Bank sentiment survey, perhaps because the lender said that all its sub-indexes showed some improvement.

$$$$
The Euro fell sharply as Asian trade got under way Monday on news that exploratory talks to form Germany’s next coalition government appeared to have collapsed.
$$$$
The pro-business Free Democratic Party walked out on Sunday night after the four parties involved missed several self-imposed deadlines to resolve differences on migration and energy policy.
$$$$
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been trying to put together a coalition between her Christian Democratic Union, its Bavarian equivalent the Christian Social Union, the FDP and the Green Party following Federal elections on September 24. Migration into Germany has emerged as the most contentious issue following the country’s refugee crisis, but there are other clear areas of difference between so disparate a grouping.
$$$$
A political vacuum in the European Union’s powerhouse would never be a welcome sight for global investors. At this point however, with UK’s exit from the bloc under torturous negotiation many Eastern states opposed to further migrant admission, it seems especially poorly timed. One modest consolation may be that the EU’s economy seems more robust than it has for years, but even that happy state may not survive a loss of German confidence.
$$$$
At any rate the Euro started a new trading week under considerable pressure. Continued political deadlock will probably mean another vote but, given Germany’s patchwork of political parties and western elections’ tendency to close results, resolution and stable government may remain elusive.
$$$$
On its daily chart EUR/USD remain in a broad and gradual downtrend from the peaks of 2017. The EU’s comparative economic vigour has seen the pair make strong gains from January’s lows, but the toll now being exacted by German political gridlock is clear.

$$$$
The British Pound rose to levels not seen since September on Thursday thanks to hope that some progress is at last being made in the torturous Brexit negotiation process.
$$$$
Reports Wednesday suggested that UK’s vexed “divorce settlement” from the European Union was approaching agreement. They were followed up by others, citing negotiators, which said that the at-least-equally prickly question of the UK’s land border with Ireland was also moving forward. While tangible progress remains scant, there does seem to be at least an impression that talks could stop stalling and possibly move along to trade and the UK’s post-Brexit position. This is something the markets would dearly like to see.
$$$$
Sterling investors certainly welcomed this prospect. GBP/USD climbed to 1.3479, it highest point since late September. 
$$$$
EUR/USD also tracked the Pound upward but at a less dramatic pace. 
$$$$
Of course, the UK currency will remain extremely vulnerable to negotiation news-flow in the days and weeks ahead. If the process so far has taught markets anything it’s that there won’t be linear progress. Setbacks will abound. Still, for the moment the scenario under which the UK crashes out of the EU without any sort of deal at all seems distant. This was something of a nightmare scenario for markets because of the myriad questions it would leave unanswered, both for the UK and the 26-member bloc.
$$$$
GBP/USD has now risen for nearly all of the past fourteen sessions, helped admittedly by some general US Dollar weakness last week as the US Federal Reserve seemed more worried than it had been by inflation’s weakness.
$$$$
It remains in a clear uptrend channel form the lows of mid-November and, indeed, has just attempted to break out of that range to the upside.

$$$$
The US Dollar was steady against the Euro and other majors Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen made one of her last public speeches from the helm of the central bank.
$$$$
Speaking at the Stern Business School in New York, Yellen said that the Fed was “reasonably close” to its goals and should keep raising interest rates gradually. She spoke a day after announcing her retirement, which is expected to take effect in February 2018.
$$$$
Yellen said that raising rates was key to dealing with any potential future negative economic shock, but that doing so too slowly risked over-tightening the labour market. She also said that the Fed sought to avoid the “boom and bust” patterns of the past.
$$$$
All up there wasn’t a lot of news for markets to grip onto here, and the prospect of an interest-rate increase next month remains extremely bright. With that all-but nailed down to the markets’ satisfaction, the burning question is how many might follow it. Yellen offered little insight here beyond saying that there will be more, but that they will be gradual. This is an old line now, and got little reaction in the markets.
$$$$
A bullish Goldman Sachs said Tuesday that a tight labour market and rising inflation will see the Fed raise rates four times in 2018, as long as Congress can pass tax reform.
$$$$
On its broader, daily chart, EUR/USD remains trapped in a downtrend from this year’s peaks.
$$$$
The Eurozone economy is doing reasonably well but German electoral wrangling, Brexit talks and the restive politics of many of its eastern member states have combined to weigh on the single currency.

Asian equity markets traded narrow ranges Thursday with direction mostly guided by local earnings reports amid a dearth of local economic data.

$$$$
In currency markets the Euro inched up as investors looked ahead to Thursday’s European Central Bank monetary-policy meeting. The ECB is widely expected to announce the reduction of its bond-buying stimulus, the biggest step yet in scaling back years of post-crisis monetary easing. Monthly bond buying could be trimmed to EUR40 billion (US$47 billion), from EUR 60 billion now, which would of course still leave the bank’s overall policy stance extremely accommodative. The Australian Dollar gained back some of the losses it incurred Wednesday when inflation data underwhelmed. Its New Zealand cousin remains weighed down by political concerns but didn’t fall far on news of a wider-than-expected trade gap.
$$$$
Gold prices edged up with EUR/USD, while crude oil prices slipped on Wednesday’s news of another US inventory build-up.

Just getting started in the EUR/USD trading world? Our beginners’ guide is here for you
$$$$
The Euro was perhaps surprisingly steady as a new trading week kicked off in Asia Monday, despite news of quite widespread violence in the independence vote in Spain’s Catalonia region.
$$$$
EUR/USD fell, but by less than a US cent and soon revived itself to get back above the 1.18 handle. However, markets will have been more thinly traded than usual thanks to holidays in both China and Australia, which may account for some of the relaxed response.
$$$$
Spanish police have used batons and rubber bullets to try to halt the independence referendum which the government regards as unconstitutional and illegal. However, Catalan separatists are claiming a huge win for their side leaving both Madrid and the European Union with a huge problem in calming the situation. Spain is the European Union’s fifth largest national economy and will move up to fourth place following the UK’s departure. Catalonia accounts for about 20% of total Spanish output.
$$$$
Asian investors may be more focused on Saturday’s economic data out of China, which was tremendously positive. The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose at its strongest pace since 2012 in September, hitting 52.4 from 51.7 in August. In the logic of PMI surveys any print over the 50 mark signifies expansion. New orders also topped output. These numbers were followed by news of record South Korean exports.
$$$$
EUR/USD has perked up markedly in recent months as the Eurozone economy has shown clear signs of improvement. However, it has backtracked more recently still as the US Dollar has been more composed and the Federal Reserve has appeared more certain that interest rates will rise again in December of this year.
$$$$
The Catalan situation remains fluid in any case and, given those market holidays in Asia, the true response may have to await Monday’s European trading session.

$$$$
Most Asian stock indexes tracked Wall Street higher on Friday with the exception of Australia’s ASX 200. It slipped thanks to a political storm which threatens the government.
$$$$
The country’s Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has been disqualified from office because he has been judged to have held dual nationality at the time of his election. There has been a smouldering political storm over dual nationality in Australian politics for some time but this latest flare is significant because it could mean that the government’s wafer-thin majority- one seat- is lost. Australia’s constitution prohibits dual-nationalists from election.
$$$$
The ASX was down 0.2% at the close, but the Nikkei 225 added 1.2% with all other major Asia/Pacific indexes in the green. 
$$$$
The Australian Dollar took a modest hit on the Joyce story on a day which saw the US Dollar garner general support. EUR/USD hit three-month lows as markets digested Thursday’s European Central Bank monetary policy call and found it less “hawkish” than had been expected. The Japanese Yen didn’t rise far despite another quite strong inflation print from its homeland. 
$$$$
Gold prices slipped a little on that stronger US Dollar while crude oil prices rose, reportedly on Saudi support for an extended production cut.
$$$$
Asian traders may now be contemplating the weekend but there are some big data still to come Friday. Top of the bill will be official US third-quarter Gross Domestic Product Numbers, but the University of Michigan’s consumer confidence indicator is also due.

Euro appreciated as ECB’s President Mario Draghi spoke at Jackson Hole, Wyoming

Draghi failed to mention a word on monetary policy, disappointing dovish expectations

The ECB’s President then rose concerns about inflation, pushing back some Euro gains
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
See how the trading community is positioned in the Euro on the DailyFX Sentiment Page.
$$$$
The Euro posted a late-in-the-week rally following ECB’s President Mario Draghi’s remarks in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. During the Fed’s economic symposium, the central bank president weighed in on subjects such as protectionism, the global recovery since the Great Financial Crisis and lax regulations. Notably absent though was any reference to their current loose monetary policy efforts and when they may begin to normalize.
$$$$
According to Senior Currency Strategist Christopher Vecchio, high expectations that the European Central Bank will taper its monetary stimulus (also known as QE) perhaps as early as September made this week a litmus test for the Euro. That in turn positioned the Jackson Hole speech as top tier economic event risk for a currency that has advanced throughout 2017.
$$$$
What was absent from his speech seemed to be what helped push EUR/USD to its highest level since January 2015. Generic Eurozone 2-year government bond yields have been falling this week signaling a recent buildup of some dovish ECB monetary policy expectations. Perhaps Draghi failing to broach the subject disappointed those bets more than drive the nascent hawkish reversal views.
$$$$
However, the Euro’s strength did not last forever. Forty minutes after his main remarks, Draghi took questions during a Q&A session. During the open forum, the central bank head mentioned that the ECB is not yet there on inflation and they therefore must remain on guard. He also added that a significant degree of accommodation is still warranted. With liquidity draining into the weekend, the market took that familiar language as its cue to top gains and turn the focus to next week.

$$$$
The Euro slipped a little in early Asian trade Monday after Germany’s election showed surging support for a nationalist party and Chancellor Angela Merkel still in charge but under pressure to form a new coalition government.
$$$$
Her Christian Democratic Union remains the largest single bloc but it scored its worst showing since 1949 while the right-wing, euroskeptic Alternative for Deutschland party made big gains. It came in third place. The CDU’s current coalition partners, the Social Democrats, said they would go into opposition after their support fell to a post-war low, leaving Merkel to build a new ruling grouping on uncertain foundations.
$$$$
She has made it clear that she will not be inviting AfD to join her government. 
$$$$
EUR/USD stumbled but didn’t fall far as the results came in. This may be because Merkel remains clearly in power and, as the longest-serving leader of the Group of Seven, she is seen as a formidable coalition builder and perhaps the most “known quantity” in international affairs.
$$$$
Still, it remains to be seen what effect the increased presence of AfD will have on German politics. The European Union is attempting to portray itself as strong and united in the wake of the Brexit vote and the burnishing of a skeptic party in its largest national player may have repercussions for the further political integration that the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron, among others, would like to see.
$$$$
More broadly EUR/USD has enjoyed a long climb up from April’s lows as Eurozone economic data have improved and the US Dollar hand languished. Now however the pair appears to be topping out around current levels as US monetary policy remains clearly in tightening mode while the European Central Bank is moving much more gingerly to wind back its own stimulus.
$$$$
The pair appears to have made a “lower high” on September 20 last week when it topped out at 1.1988. That was below the previous peak which was September 8’s 1.2061.

Asian markets started the week quite strongly despite the looming start of Brexit talks and what looks like yet another terror attack in London.
$$$$
With the US Federal Reserve’s June interest rate decision out of the way risk appetite seems to endure, in Asia at least. The Nikkei ended up 0.6% with all other Asia/Pacific bourses in the green too. Chinese indexes got some support from news that home price rises had slowed, although the market remains buoyant.
$$$$
In the foreign-exchange space the US Dollar made modest upward progress, as markets eye at least one more interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve this year. New York Fed President William Dudley is due to speak later in Pittsburgh. Investors reportedly hope he may shed a little light on this prospect. Meanwhile the Euro showed little initial reaction to news that French President Emmanuel Macron’s party or its allies had achieved a majority in parliamentary elections. However, EUR/USD perked up as European trading started.
$$$$
Brexit talks finally get under way in Brussels later Monday, but the British Pound was relaxed in the runup. The New Zealand Dollar also rose through the session, but it did so quite a long time after the release of positive consumer confidence and service sector numbers which, in any case, don’t often move the market.
$$$$
Other Asian data showed a surprise shortfall for Japanese trade, albeit in a release that was quite strong in the breakdown. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe stuck to well-worn ground in his Monday speech, although he did fret that slow wage growth in Australia might be something we have to get used to.
$$$$
Crude oil prices lost about 14 cents/barrel in the caser of both the US benchmark and international Brent as a relentless expansion in US drilling weighed on prices yet again. Gold prices fell modestly in the face of a rising US Dollar but hit a new four-week low of $1,250.80/ounce as it did so.
$$$$There's very little scheduled economic data due for the remainder of the global session, with Eurozone construction output likey to top a thin bill. $$$$

$$$$
The Euro was steady early in Friday’s European session as German growth an inflation numbers came in right on market expectations.
$$$$
The initial official look at Gross Domestic Product growth for the Eurozone’s largest national economy in the first quarter of 2017 came in at 0.7% on the quarter. That meant a 1.7% gain compared with the same period last year. Both were exactly as predicted by forecasters.
$$$$
Without seasonal adjustment annualized growth was 2.9%, a tick above expectations, and the German statistics office said there was some evidence that domestic consumption helped growth.
$$$$
EUR/USD had bumped through a rather dull Asian foreign exchange session, and the data didn’t alter things much. It remained around 1.0870, with investors possibly waiting for a look at US consumer prices later in the global session.
$$$$
On that topic, final German consumer price index data for April were released at the same time as the GDP data. They, too came in as expected and as previously reported. The CPI was flat on the month and up 2% compared to April 2016.

Euro bulls can hope for a little support from economic data on Wednesday provided all goes as planned.
$$$$
The markets expect a solid official first-quarter Gross Domestic Product print out of the Eurozone when initial estimates see daylight at 0900 GMT. Growth is expected to be 0.5% on the quarter and 1.7% on the year. If so the figures will top their equivalents from the US but undercut the UK. Still, they will probably be “good enough” for markets already largely bought-in to the tale of measurable if gradual recovery as told once again by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi last week.
$$$$
As-forecast data will mean the same growth rates as those seen in the last three months of 2016. The evidence is as ever mixed before the fact, but there are plenty of hopeful signs. Euro zone Purchasing Managers Indexes have been quite strong of late, but retail has been generally weaker.
$$$$
Growth results already released from France have been decidedly underwhelming (0.3% from 0.5% in the last quarter of 2016), but Spain has done better and even France may have taken an election hit. It also seems unlikely that investment growth will match the brisk 5.1% annualized pace it managed at the end of last year.
$$$$
The markets will also get a look at German unemployment figures for April. These come out at 0755 GMT, ahead of the Eurozone. The March fall took joblessness to its lowest levels since the country was reunified in 1990, and yet more falls are expected.
$$$$
All up these look like a quite encouraging set of data for the Eurozone and may help ameliorate a backdrop dominated by rising Brexit acrimony and the still simmering problem of Greece’s long-term future within the bloc.
$$$$
The numbers come as the single currency is at or close to its highs for 2017 against the US Dollar.
$$$$
Improving Performance: EUR/USD
$$$$
However, while the data from the “EUR” side of the currency cross have broadly improved, it might be a mistake to impute too much of this strength to that alone, especially with a Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting looming.
$$$$
It must be at least as likely that the last month’s weaker US economic numbers have cast some doubts on the likely longevity of the Fed’s interest-rate hawkishness, even if the markets still think that two more rises are probable this year.

Euro Dips As German Inflation Disappoints 	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2017/03/30/Euro-Dips-As-German-Inflation-Disappoints.html	1490877120	"
German inflation misses estimates.
$$$$
Poor figures were driven by lower prices for energy and food.
$$$$
ECB unlikely to change tack at April 27 meeting.

$$$$
The Euro has continued its swoon, with demand for Euro-Zone bonds also cooling, as poor German inflation figures are likely to subdue hawks in the European Central Bank. 
$$$$
German consumer price inflation came in at 1.6% year-on-year in March, missing an estimated 1.8%, and decelerating from 2.20% in February. Month-on-month CPI slowed to 0.20% in March, again missing the 0.2% consensus estimate, from 0.6% the previous month. 
$$$$
The weaker-than-expected inflation figures were driven by lower prices for energy and food as well as a reduced core rate of inflation which was mainly owed to a special seasonal factor.
$$$$
The poor data are a further setback for Euro bulls. EURUSD hit at a 10-day low earlier in Thursday’s session after the latest Euro-Zone confidence indicators slipped lower; a considerably weaker inflation rate in Spain; and a report showing weaker-than-expected inflation in Germany’s regions.
$$$$
In Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation slowed to 1.7% from 2.3% in February. It also fell back to 1.7% in Hesse and Bavaria. In the eastern state of Brandenburg, it dropped to 1.4% while it stood at 1.8% in Saxony.
$$$$
Spain's national consumer price index rose by 2.3% in March, down from 3% in February, which was much lower than expected and mostly blamed on the effect of oil prices.
$$$$
The single currency was also hit by comments today from Bank of Finland Governor Erkki Liikanen, who said the ECB needs to maintain its policy commitments and its guidance on interest rates is appropriate. The ECB’s next meeting is on April 27. 
$$$$
His comments follow Wednesday's report, citing an unnamed European Central Bank official as saying that the bank is not planning any sudden stop of its asset-purchase programme, nor are rate hikes imminent. That sent the currency on its largest drop in five weeks.
$$$$
There are now fears that the weaker CPI from Germany today could lead to a weaker flash reading of CPI from the Eurozone on Friday. 
$$$$
What’s more, there is still considerable scope for political uncertainty to put pressure on the single currency over the coming months, owing to Brexit megatons triggered by the UK’s launch of Article 50; concerns about President Trump’s US policies; upcoming elections in France and Germany; political instability in Italy; and economic woes in Greece. 
$$$$
EURUSD currently trades at 1.0742, a drop of 0.0024 on the day. Against the British Pound, it’s down 0.0040 to trade at 0.8619. Germany's DAX is positive, up 9.00 to 12,212.00.

Euro Drops as PMI Data Point to Still Sluggish Inflation	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2017/02/21/Euro-Drops-as-PMI-Data-Point-to-Still-Sluggish-Inflation.html	1487675700	"
PMI data reveal the European economy is in rude health
$$$$
But inflation is not rising enough and is unlikely to satisfy ECB policymakers
$$$$
The Euro is under pressure against G20 peers, but European stocks have gained
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
See the DailyFX Economic Calendar and see what live coverage for key event risk impacting FX markets is scheduled for the week on the DailyFX Webinar Calendar.
$$$$
The Euro is dropping against its G20 peers despite today’s PMI data showing the Euro-Zone economy firing on all cylinders. However, inflation is only creeping up slowly.
$$$$
The Euro-Zone Composite PMI climbed sharply to a 70-month high in February, from 54.4 to 56.0, and stronger than the consensus forecast of a slight fall to 54.3, suggesting that economic growth picked up pace in Q1. Growth accelerating in both manufacturing and services to rates not seen since early 2011.
$$$$
The flash composite output index rose to a 69-month high of 56.2 in February from 54.1 in January. While manufacturing growth remained unchanged, the services activity index rose to 56.7 from 54.1 in the prior month. The country breakdown also revealed sharp rises in the German and French Composite PMIs. The German index improved from 54.8 to 56.1. The French PMI recorded an even sharper climb from 54.0 to 56.2. 
$$$$
The future output index meanwhile increased to its highest level in the series’ four-year history, indicating that European companies expect February’s strength to be maintained over the next 12 months.
$$$$
However, the output prices index increased only marginally, suggesting that inflationary pressures in the region are increasing slowly. ECB policymakers will thus not yet be convinced that recent signs of a pick-up in activity will translate into sustained upward pressure on inflation.
$$$$
That fact is heaping selling pressure on the single currency in the London trading session. EURUSD is down to 1.0537, a drop of 0.0075 on the day, also helped by Dollar strength as Fed policy makers comment on the possibility of a March rate hike in the US. EURGBP has dropped 0.0031 to 0.8488. EURJPY trades at 119.78, down 0.25. 
$$$$
The Euro is also feeling the burden of the rising political risks in the region. A fresh poll Monday showed leader Marine Le Pen gaining ground on her main election rivals for the French election. 
$$$$
The poll put the far-right candidate, who wants to scrap the Euro and replace it with a basket of new national currencies, 16 points behind centrist Emmanuel Macron, down from 20 points previously for a potential second-round run off scheduled for May. Le Pen was 12 points behind the conservative candidate Francois Fillon, from 14 points previously.
$$$$
That’s rattled bond markets, too, with the premium investors demand to hold French bonds instead of German debt rising Monday to its highest since late 2012.
$$$$
European stocks have, however, edged higher on the encouraging PMI data. The CAC 40 has gained 5.31 to trade at 4,870.30. The DAX 30 has climbed half a per cent to 11,887.00.

Euro Slips Modestly After Small Gfk Confidence Miss	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2017/02/23/Euro-Slips-Modestly-After-Small-Gfk-Confidence-Miss.html	1487839740	"
The Euro backtracked a little following a very modest miss for the Gfk consumer confidence survey
$$$$
German consumers were a little less upbeat in the latest edition than they had been a month before
$$$$
The index seems to have topped out at the 10.2 level once again
"	"
Talking Points
$$$$
The Euro took a small fall early in Thursday’s European trading session by news that German consumer confidence had slipped a little.
$$$$
The monthly index for March from market research company Gfk came in at 10.0. This was a whisker below the 10.1 which markets were on the lookout for and February’s 10.2. The index is compiled on behalf of the European Commission.
$$$$
The index had been rising since December but seems to have peaked at that 10.2 mark. It did the same in 2016, rising from 9.4 in April to peak at the same 10.2 level in September. 
$$$$
Still the fall was hardly catastrophic and the Euro didn’t slide far in the aftermath. EUR/USD fell to 1.05479 from 1.05576 just before the figures. That said a little more spending from German consumers is very much what Eurozone monetary-policy makers would like to see, so in that regard this modest slip back may be dispiriting.
$$$$
Hit, but not hard: EUR/USD

The consumer confidence survey saw daylight at the same time as the final official reading of German Gross Domestic Product for 2016’s final quarter. This was in-line with the previous official estimate of 0.4% growth on the quarter and 1.7% growth on the year, both seasonally adjusted. Without adjustment the on-year growth rate was 1.2%, again as expected.

Euro-Zone PMI data are encouraging, but headline figure still misses market estimates.

$$$$
The Euro dropped slightly versus its major rivals after Euro-Zone PMI data released Tuesday morning showed encouraging growth in the Euro region, but not enough to put the European Central Bank off its plans of sustained policy loosening.
$$$$
The headline Euro-Zone Composite PMI for January fell slightly from 54.4 in December to 54.3 and was weaker than the 54.6 expected by the market. But, at well above the 50.0 level that indicates flat activity, it still suggests that economic growth continued at a steady pace at the start of 2017.
$$$$
The manufacturing PMI rose to a 69-month high in January to 55.1 from 54.9, although output growth eased fractionally from December’s 32-month high. The services PMI fell to 53.6 from 53.7 in December and 11-month high of 53.8.
$$$$
But, in general, the data bode well for Euro-Zone growth in the near-term. Firms added new jobs at the fastest rate in nine years, while factory growth hit a five-year high.Overall new orders growth in the services and manufacturing sector remains at the equal highest level and backlogs of work rose at a healthy rate. Business expectations for the year ahead were at their highest level for at least four-and-a-half years
$$$$
Despite these promising numbers, the Euro dropped slightly against the Dollar, Pound and Yen, illustrating the Euro’s two major problems. First, despite the positive data of late, ECB President Mario Draghi remains hell-bent on maintaining his QE-supportive tone. Second, traders are concerned about the longer-term political scene in Europe, with potentially debstabisliing elections in Germany, the Netherlands, France and potentially Italy all looming this year. 
$$$$
EURUSD fell slightly after the PMI release to a session low of 1.07310. EURGBP also dipped, though quickly rose again on the news of the landmark ruling in the UK stating that its parliament must vote on whether the government can start the Brexit process. EURJPY dipped slightly too, and currently trades at121.66.

Dovish ECB Drags on EUR/USD- Draghi Warns Inflation Remains Subdued	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2017/01/19/Dovish-ECB-Drags-on-EURUSD--Draghi-Warns-Inflation-Remains-Subdued.html	1484834820	"

$$$$
EUR/USD heads lower after dovish comments by Mario Draghi
"	"
As broadly expected by the market, the ECB erred on the side of caution and decided to keep its key interest rates on hold after convening for its first policy meeting of 2017. 
$$$$
The monetary authority maintained its Main refinancing rate unchanged at 0.0%, its Marginal Lending Facility at 0.250% and its Deposit Facility rate at -0.40%. In addition, policy makers did not make any changes to its bond-buying stimulus scheme, and said that the entity would continue asset purchases at &euro;80 billion a month until the end of March and then at €60 billion a month from April to December 2017. 
$$$$
In the press conference that followed, Mario Draghi stressed that underlying inflationary pressures in the European region remain subdued and that there is no convincing evidence of an upward trend in consumer prices. As far as the health of the broad economy, Draghi indicated that risks to the outlook continue skewed to the downside for which the ECB did not discuss reducing stimulus at this meeting. 
$$$$
Chart 1: EUR/USD 1-minute Chart (Jan 19, 2017 Intraday)

Immediately, after the Draghi´s dovish remarks crossed the wires, EUR/USD dropped as low as 1.0602, or 0.2% in intraday trading as market participants speculated that monetary policy would remain accommodative for longer in the economic bloc in the absence of persistent inflationary pressures and negative risks to the outlook.

$$$$
The US Dollar index fell a little over 1.5 percent from Wednesday highs today following President-elect Donald Trump’s first press conference since July. While many topics were covered, the particulars for the economy and trade which concern traders and investors were fewer than many had hoped. 
$$$$
Within the press conference, the incoming US President remarked on relations with two of the more common international relationships during the campaign and after. Trump addressed the United States’ diplomatic relationship with Russia, suggesting the country may have engaged in hacking. In reference to Mexico, he would suggest that their government has been accommodating, but stuck to the view that they would share in the cost of a wall at the two countries’ border – a physical barrier some DailyFX analysts believe will translate into a relationship obstruction. 
$$$$
Domestically, Trump spoke about business development in the US, and said that “there will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving.” Details on the tax were not provided. Major issues regarding the President-elect’s position on general US trade policies, prospective fiscal stimulus and relations with China were notably absent from the press conference. Economists, analysts and investors are particularly interested in these broader points to guide their economic and market assessments for 2017 and beyond with speculative appetite already running hot.  
$$$$
The US Dollar fell against most of its major counterparts, with the EUR/USD trading 1.72 percent higher from the day’s low. The USD/JPY was notably lower, falling as much as 2.4 percent following the press conference. The GBP/USD rose by nearly 2 percent off its lows today as well. Without details on fiscal stimulus or tax policy, growth forecasts are still open ended. Lacking clarity on the trade particulars, inflation expectations which have fueled Fed rate forecasts are tempered.

$$$$
The British Pound is under pressure after an unexpected drop in UK mortgage approvals in November.
$$$$
The British Bankers Association (BBA) reported Wednesday that the number of mortgage approvals fell to 40,659 in the month, down from 40,835 in October and against estimates of a rise to 41,400.
$$$$
The BBA data follow from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has reported that buyer enquiries for houses rose for a third month running in November – although the increase was still relatively modest. Buyer enquiries had earlier fallen for six months running through to August.
$$$$
Economists are now concerned that the UK housing market could struggle next year, with some predicting there will be house price drops in 2016. 
$$$$
GBPUSD dropped to a low of 1.22967 in Wednesday trading, and is currently at 1.22413.
$$$$
It follows comments from the former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, who at the beginning of the week suggested that the UK government is better off seeking a ‘hard Brexit’ option when it formerly launches the exit from the European Union next year, sparking fears amoung traders about the impact that would have on the UK’s economy and its currency. 
$$$$
Mervyn King said: “I don’t think it makes sense for us to pretend we should remain in the single market and I think there are real question marks about whether it makes sense to remain in the customs union.”
$$$$
However, the BBC reports that other pro-Brexit campaigners have asked business groups across the EU to push for Britain’s continued access to the single market, in order to help prevent disruption to trade.
$$$$
The group called ‘Leave Means Leave’ has written to the chambers of commerce in all the other 27 EU states, asking them to call for a ""sensible agreement regarding the terms of Britain's exit from the EU"". It says trade barriers would have a ""detrimental effect"" and calls for uninterrupted trade as well as near-zero tariffs.

$$$$
A seemingly quiet transition into Friday’s trading session was shaken by a surge in activity for the Forex market’s most stalwart corners. EUR/USD, the FX market’s most liquid cross, surged between the US close and Tokyo open for the final trading day of the 2016. The exchange rate surged as much as 132 pips - or 1.2 percent – in the span of two minutes starting at 23:39 GMT. All Euro crosses responded with the scale of the move spilling over to most Dollar and Pound crosses. 
$$$$
There was a notable absence of newswire fodder to source the dramatic move. However, these large moves do not come as much of a surprise given the conditions usually experienced at this time of the year. As Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak noted, sudden drops (or gains) seem to be a textbook case study in the amplifying effects of illiquid market conditions. Looking at Euro futures, the active contract turned over more than 20,000 contracts during the hour it fell under. That was the heaviest volume since December 22nd and the heaviest ‘after hours’ since November 8th – US elections night.
$$$$
Further leveraging the impact through shallow market depth, these moves occurred during the early hours of Friday’s Asia session. Compared to the time of day when the London and New York market overlap, this period is generally considered the most illiquid period of the 24 hour cycle.

$$$$
The British Pound has made slight gains on the Dollar after the latest House Price Index from Nationwide, a building society, released Thursday showed that UK house price growth was relatively stable in 2016. UK annual house price growth ended 2016 at 4.5%, according to the data, beating estimates of a 3.8% rise. 
$$$$
Commenting on the figures, Robert Gardner, Nationwide's Chief Economist, said: “The story of UK house price growth in 2016 was one of relative stability. Annual house price growth ended 2016 at 4.5%, the same as the rate recorded in 2015.” 
$$$$
GBPUSD is now back up to 1.2255, having been as low as 1.2200 earlier this week after UK mortgage approvals unexpectedly fell in November, and comments from the former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King. He suggested that the UK government is better off seeking a ‘hard Brexit’ option when it formally launches the exit from the European Union next year, sparking fears among traders about the impact that would have on the UK’s economy and its currency. The Pound is slightly down against the Euro, but that’s mainly due to single currency’s gains. The Euro has recovered a little composure after Wednesday’s precipitous fall. 
$$$$
However, the report contained fears about a slowdown in prices in 2017, which may slightly unnerve Sterling bulls. Nationwide said house price growth is likely to slow next year. “Looking ahead to 2017, house price prospects will depend crucially on developments in the wider economy, around which there is a greater degree of uncertainty than usual,” said Gardner.
$$$$
“Like most forecasters, including the Bank of England, we expect the UK economy to slow modestly next year, which is likely to result in less robust labour market conditions and modestly slower house price growth.” He added that a small gain - around 2% - is more likely than a decline over 2017 as a whole, since low interest rates are expected to help underpin demand while a shortage of homes on the market will continue to provide support for house prices.
$$$$
There were also warnings that the above-average performance of London's housing market may be drawing to a close. “For the first year since 2008, annual house price growth in the capital was lower than the UK average, with prices increasing by 3.7% over the year, down from 12.2% in 2015,” said Gardner.

Euro Fights Back After Wednesday's Sudden Drop	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2016/12/29/Euro-Fights-Back-After-Wednesdays-Sudden-Drop.html	1482985860	"
EUR/USD slid sharply on Wednesday, but is looking more composed in Asia on Thursday
$$$$
There was no obvious catalyst for its rebound, although a pullback in US yields may have helped
$$$$
The data schedule is ‘holiday light’ for the rest of this week, though, and focused on the US
"	"
Talking Points
$$$$
The Euro has recovered a little composure after Wednesday’s precipitous fall, and EUR/USD looks comfortable for now above the 1.04 handle on Thursday in Asia.
$$$$
Just as there was no clear specific reason for the single currency’s swallow dive below that level, there seems no obvious catalyst for its rebound.
$$$$
That weakness may have been down to a delayed “holiday” reaction to Monday’s news that flailing Italian lender Monti Dei Paschi di Siena will need more rescue cash than previously thought. And Thursday’s relative pep may be down to a slip in US Treasury yields following lacklustre pending-home sales and a well-bid Treasury auction, but the usual seasonal caution about thin markets probably applies in spades.
$$$$
Even so EUR/USD is steady around the 1.0436 area, having fallen as far as 1.0383 at the nadir of its Wednesday slide.
$$$$
The rest of this week brings more scheduled-event risk to the “Dollar” side of EUR/USD. Economic data for Thursday and Friday are focused on the US, with jobless claims and oil inventory probably most notable among the numbers due. 
$$$$
The British Pound shared much of the Euro’s fate against the Dollar on Wednesday, but has seen a similar rebound in Asia. GBP/USD is back up to 1.22430, having been as low as 1.2200.

The US Dollar failed to benefit from news that the Markit flash US manufacturing PMI came in above expectations, with new orders expanding at the quickest pace since September 2014. Markit posted a PMI of 55.1 in January, up from 54.3 in December, against market estimates of 54.5, to signal a marked upturn in the health of the sector that was the strongest since March 2015.
$$$$
The US manufacturing sector’s strong start to the year was largely driven by sharper increases in output and new orders, which rose at the fastest rates in 22 and 28months respectively. US manufacturers raised their purchasing activity at the steepest rate since early 2015 and reported increased production for the eighth month running in January. Furthermore, the rate of expansion picked up to its sharpest since March 2015.
$$$$
But despite the steepest increase in new orders in 28 months, export orders were stagnant and the rate of job creation, though solid overall, eased slightly from the 18-month high seen in December.
$$$$
Commenting on the data, Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, said: “US manufacturers are seeing a bumper start to 2017, with production surging higher in January on the back of rising inflows of new orders. 
$$$$
“New work is growing at the fastest rate for over two years, thanks mainly to rising demand from customers in the home market. Export growth remains subdued, stymied by the strong dollar. 
$$$$
“The survey results suggest that faster manufacturing growth and inventory rebuilding should help boost GDP in the first quarter if current trends persist in coming months. Rising factory employment should also help improve consumer morale and spending.”
$$$$
He added that the strong growth and increase in price pressures may spur speculation around the next rate hike by the Federal Reserve – which you would expect to boost the Dollar. 
$$$$
But EURUSD spiked in the run up to the data and is now trading sideways around 1.0750. It’s a similar story with GBPUSD, which is hovering around 1.2500, and USDJPY, which is at around 113.30. The US Dollar Index, which measures the value of the Dollar relative to a basket of the top six currencies, is down 0.06% on the day at 100.10. 
$$$$
This may be explained by US existing home sales data, which quickly followed the PMI, and which fell more than expected in December by 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted 5.49 million units from 5.65 million units in the previous month. The consensus forecast was for a 1.1% decrease to 5.52 million units. However, home sales still registered their best year in a decade.
$$$$
The lack of momentum is most likely down to President Trump’s rhetoric continuing to weigh on the Dollar, and traders will now continue to look to the Trump administration for clues to the potential path of the Greenback in the near to medium term. The Dollar has ceded ground recently amid speculation that the Trump administration will seek to bring it down. Yesterday, the Dollar was hit after US Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin said an “excessively strong dollar” could have a negative short-term effect on the economy.

Euro Slips Despite Better Deutsche Bank Results	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2017/02/02/Euro-Slips-Despite-Better-Deutsche-Bank-Results.html	1486020000	"
Deutsche Bank earnings could have been worse, but the Euro slipped after them anyway
$$$$
The troubled lender recorded a lower than expected fourth quarter loss
$$$$
Tier 1 capital looks strong
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
The Euro faded a little on Thursday despite the release of some better-than-expected earnings figures from troubled German investment-banking giant Deutsche Bank AG. 
$$$$
It said its net loss for the three months to December 2016 was €1.89 billion ($2.04 billion) compared with €2.2 billion a year earlier. Analysts had been looking for a €2.2 billion shortfall according to wire reports.
$$$$
The lender announced a full-year net loss of €1.4 billion for 2016 as a whole, massively better than the €7.3 billion miss in 2015. It also said that its Tier-1 capital was 11.9% at year-end, up from 11.1% in December 2015 and the strongest for twelve quarters. This is a key measure of any bank’s financial strength. It has gained extraordinary prominence in investors’ minds since the financial crisis exposed many banks as far weaker than they had appeared.
$$$$
Net revenue was €7.1 billion above EUR6.6 billion in the final three months of 2015.
$$$$
Deutsche shares fell sharply in mid-2016 after a proposed $14 billion settlement with the US Justice Department related to the selling of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Investors were then worried about the German titan’s capital position but its management always insisted that its shoulders remained broad enough to cope.
$$$$
Since then the bank has sold off its UK insurance business, slashed bonus payouts and cut staffing levels. In January of this year it was announced that Deutsche would pay $7.2 billion for misleading investors. The Department of Justice said that this was the largest single RMBS resolution for the conduct of a single entity.
$$$$
Combined with penalties imposed in the US and the UK, the German titan has agreed to almost $8 billion in settlements to end probes into RMBS sales and other compliance failures. Not all of the bank’s problems have been of its own making. Indeed, they are arguably just the most visible sign of the toxic effects of very low interest rates and uninspiring economic growth on European banking as a whole.
$$$$
The Euro retreated modestly after the earnings were released, which was early in the European market session. EUR/USD slipped to 1.07894 just after they hit the wires, from 1.07946 beforehand. 
$$$$
Deutsche Bank’s shares are up more than 10% for 2017 so far and have more than doubled in price from the multi-year lows seen September, 2016.

Modest knockback: EUR/USD

Euro Gains On Monte Paschi State-Rescue Plan	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2016/12/23/Euro-Gains-On-Monte-Paschi-State-Rescue-Plan.html	1482468000	"
The single currency picked up in Asia on news that the Italian cabinet was debating a rescue for Monte dei Paschi DeSiena
$$$$
The tottering lender said this week that it had failed to secure sufficient private capital to carry on
$$$$
A state lifeline has been the only viable option since
"	"
Talking Points
$$$$
The Euro got a small lift in Friday’s Asian session on news that the Italian cabinet met late Thursday in Rome and agreed at State-led rescue of tottering lender Monte dei Paschi De Siena (known as “Monte Paschi”).
$$$$
The world’s oldest bank said earlier that it had failed to secure sufficient private capital to keep it going. This probably made government aid inevitable, and indeed it was widely anticipated in the market. Still, investors took heart from the news that Rome is on the case.
$$$$
EUR/USD rose from 1.04367 to 1.04439 after the news broke. However, Asian markets are thinned by the looming holiday break which will mean early closures in Auckland and Sydney. Tokyo is out of the game completely as Japan celebrates the Emperor’s Birthday holiday. This may mean that reaction was more muted than it might have been in a more typical session.
$$$$
On Wednesday, Italy’s parliament authorized the government to borrow up to EUR20 billion ($20.9 billion) to bolster struggling banks starting with Monte Paschi, which has long been the gloomy poster child for Italy’s financial-sector problems.
$$$$
On Thursday, Monte Paschi itself said that it had managed to raise less than half of the five billion euros in new capital it needed to secure by year-end to avoid being wound down. The bank was founded in 1472 for the provision of charitable loans to the needy, but now finds itself in need of donations.
$$$$
Many Italian banks have struggled with bad loans, over-staffing and the legacy of Italy’s long economic stagnation. Total bad loans in the sector are reportedly some EUR365 billion, or 17% of balance sheets.
$$$$
However, Italian shares have risen in recent sessions on hopes of the “benign” state bailout of Monte Paschi which now appears to be in the offing.

Confidence booster? EUR/USD

EUR/USD Little Changed Despite Upbeat Eurozone PMI Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2016/11/23/EURUSD-Little-Changed-Despite-Upbeat-Eurozone-PMI-Data.html	1479896520	"
Latest Euro-Zone data paint a better-than-expected picture
$$$$
Growth and inflation both on the up
$$$$
EUR/USD little changed as a strong dollar continues to rule the roost
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
EUR/USD barely moved in early European trading Wednesday despite better-than-expected Eurozone PMIs pointing to stronger growth in Europe. Inflation pressures also jumped to their highest levels in five years, some good news for ECB President Mario Draghi ahead of the December 8 monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt.
$$$$
The preliminary ‘flash’ Markit Euro-Zone Composite PMI - based on approximately 85% of final survey replies - rose to 54.1, up from 53.3 in October. The latest reading signalled the strongest monthly increase in output since December. A break-down of the figures show the services sector expanding at its fastest rate in 11 months while the manufacturing sector eased slightly.
$$$$
Commenting on the flash PMI data, Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, said: “The preliminary PMI results for November indicate the sharpest monthly increase in business activity so far this year, with plenty of signs that growth will continue to accelerate. The PMI readings so far for the fourth quarter point to GDP expanding 0.4%, led by a rebound in German growth to 0.5%. France is also seen to be enjoying its best spell since the start of the year, with the PMIs signalling GDP growth of 0.2-0.3% in the fourth quarter.”
$$$$
Today’s data also highlighted a steady build-up of inflationary pressures in the pipeline. The average prices charged for services and goods recorded the biggest rise in five years. Average input prices showed the largest rise for one-and-a-half years with manufacturing input prices hitting a four-and-a-half year high.
$$$$
EUR/USD barely changed after the release, with other pressures directing the pair. The US Dollar index (DXY) remains close to its highest level since 2004, while the yield differential between the 2-year US Treasury and its German counterpart is just over 181 basis points, the widest differential in 11 years.

German business confidence stayed at October’s healthy level in November.
$$$$
However, German GDP growth was confirmed at just 0.2% in the third quarter
$$$$
The Euro and the DAX did not seem to show a discrete reaction to the data
"	"
Talking points:
$$$$
German business confidence remained at October’s healthy level in November, suggesting that GDP growth in Europe’s largest economy should improve in the fourth quarter from the third quarter’s depressed level.
$$$$
“Confidence in the German economy continues to be good. The Ifo Business Climate Index remained unchanged at 110.4 points in November,” commented Clemens Fuest, President of the Ifo Institute. “Firms were once again more satisfied with their current business situation, but with regard to the coming months they are somewhat less optimistic. The economic upturn in Germany remains intact. The German economy seems to be unfazed by the election of Donald Trump as US President,” he added.
$$$$
The news followed earlier confirmation that the German economy slumped in the July-September quarter. Growth was confirmed at just 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, half the growth rate of the previous three months. That’s equivalent to annualized expansion of 0.8%, way below the 2.9% recorded in the US, with weak trade figures largely to blame.
$$$$
The DAX – Germany’s main stock-market index – seemed to pay little heed to the confidence data but looks to be broadly supported at the time of writing, trading up 0.2% at 10,683. The Euro was little changed against the Dollar, with EUR/USD at 1.0562.

Euro Under Pressure as ECB's Draghi says More is Needed	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2016/11/18/Euro-Under-Pressure-as-ECBs-Draghi-says-More-is-Needed.html	1479477300	"
EUR/USD hits a near 1-year low on ECB commentary
$$$$
US Dollar continues to soar
$$$$
Italian constitutional referendum the next potential Euro roadblock
"	"
Talking Points
$$$$
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi knocked the common currency lower early Friday after he told a conference in Frankfurt that Europe’s ultra-loose monetary accommodation will continue. President Draghi said that “a sustained adjustment” in the path of inflation still relies on the continuation of the current, unprecedented financing conditions. 
$$$$
“It is for this reason that we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation, which is necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards level below, but close to, 2% over the medium-term.”
$$$$
President Draghi’s latest speech underscores expectations that the ECB will extend its EUR80 billion a month quantitative easing program when the central bank meets in December. Analysts now expect the ECB to extend the bond buying program for another six months after its original March 2017 end date. 
$$$$
And it is not just ECB commentary that is weighing on EUR/USD as the President-elect Trump inspired dollar rally continues apace. The US Dollar index (DXY) is currently trading at a near 14-year high on expectations that Trump will announce a large fiscal package early next year, boosting inflation and sending bond yields even higher.
$$$$
And looking ahead, the path of least resistance for the Euro remains firmly to the downside as the Italian constitutional referendum edges closer. Italy will go to the polls on December 4 to vote on a new constitutional reform package aimed at making it easier for the government to pass legislation. However, PM Matteo Renzi has said that he will resign if the reforms are not passed, and the polls are currently evenly balanced on the outcome. If a general election is called, the anti-EU Five Star Movement party is riding high in the polls, fueling concerns of an ‘Italexit’ referendum next year.
$$$$
These concerns are already being seen in the Italian government bond market with 10-year benchmark yields hitting their highest level since July 2015. The current yield of 2.11% is also double the all-time low of 1.05% made in early August this year. 
$$$$
EUR/USD currently trades around 1.0605 after having touched a near one-year low of 1.0580 earlier in the European session.

Germany’s Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says his country will work with whoever Donald Trump chooses as US Treasury Secretary
$$$$
Jens Weidmann, the President of Germany’s Bundesbank, argues that unconventional policy tools should be used with extra care
$$$$
But European Central Bank President Mario Draghi hints at further monetary-policy support for the Euro-Zone economy
$$$$
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard repeats that he is leaning towards supporting a December US rate increase
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
Further monetary-policy stimulus for the sluggish Euro-Zone economy and a December rate increase in the US both remain likely after a series of speakers on Friday skirted round the key current market issues of the impact on the bloc of the UK’s decision to leave the EU and the election of Donald Trump as the next US President.
$$$$
Taken together, the remarks look set to add to the downward pressure on the Euro, particularly against the US dollar. The EUR/USD pair was stable on Friday after falling from above 1.11 on November 7 to just over 1.06 at the time of writing.
$$$$
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said his country will work together with a new US administration, including whoever Trump appoints as Treasury Secretary, noting that “we must respect what they vote for and work with them as well as possible”.
$$$$
European central bankers, however, concentrated on Euro-Zone monetary policy in comments that did nothing to change the market perception that the European Central Bank is likely to extend its asset-purchase program for six months after March next year, when it is currently due to end.
$$$$
In comments likely to prevent any long-term recovery by the Euro, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said “the recovery remains highly reliant on a constellation of financing conditions that, in turn, depend on continued monetary support”. He added: “The ECB will continue to act, as warranted, by using all the instruments available within our mandate to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards a level below, but close to 2%.”
$$$$
Read more on the ECB here.
$$$$
However, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann – who is also a member of the ECB’s Governing Council and is regarded as more hawkish than Draghi – argued that “unconventional instruments should be used with extra care – even if they are used only temporarily”.
$$$$
The remarks by Draghi contrasted sharply with comments by Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard, who is also a voting member of the US rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Speaking at the same European banking conference in Frankfurt as Draghi, Bullard repeated earlier comments that he is leaning towards supporting a rate increase next month.
$$$$
However, he went further, hinting that rates could move higher again next year. “Markets are currently putting a high probability on a December move by the FOMC. I’m leaning towards supporting that,” he said. “I think the question now is more about 2017.”

Euro Slides as Renzi Defeat Puts Spotlight on Stricken Banks	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2016/12/05/Euro-Slides-as-Renzi-Defeat-Puts-Spotlight-on-Stricken-Banks.html	1480901460	"
Matteo Renzi has said that he will be stepping down as Italian Prime Minister
$$$$
His party was defeated in a constitutional referendum on which he had staked his future
$$$$
Markets now fear that the economic reform Italy needs has just become much harder
"	"
Talking Points
$$$$
The Euro took a big knock on Monday in Asia following Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s decision to resign in the wake of a referendum defeat.
$$$$
Mr. Renzi said that voters had shown a “clear” rejection of the legislative reforms on which he had staked his political future.
$$$$
“My experience of government ends here,” Renzi said in a televised address as the results showed that his “Yes” camp was going to lose.
$$$$
Sunday’s vote was on whether the country’s second chamber should lose some of its powers. Legislative delay has long hamstrung attempts at economic reform in Italy and the new rules would have made it necessary for new laws to pass only the lower house to get onto the statute book.
$$$$
However, the opposition to the vote claimed that the new provisions would have led to a concentration of power. The main issues for markets are the question of whether Italy can possibly reform fast enough to boost its struggling economy, and the increasing power of a populist vote which could threaten the country’s membership in the Eurozone.
$$$$
One of the most visible signs of that economic struggle is the banking sector. There the largest banks reportedly hold a combined $300 billiion of bad loans, debt securities and off-balance sheet items, wreckage of the Eurozone’s financial crisis which has yet to be cleared away.
$$$$
Worries about this have seen equity prices in the sector fall by nearly 50% this year.
$$$$
News that Austria’s far-right candiate for President – an arch euroskeptic – had been defeated by the more pro-EU alternative might have supported the Euro a little. Norbert Hofer conceded defeat to the Green Party backed Alexander Van der Bellen. However, the Italian vote was always the bigger deal for markets and the single currnecy has duly swooned.
$$$$
EUR/USD hit 1.05328, a base from which it has since fought back a litle, from 1.06683 before the election news started to break.

$$$$
Traders are braced for volatility when Italy holds a referendum on constitutional reform on Sunday. It’s the biggest event risk for the Euro since Brexit, and markets are jittery about the prospect of a ‘No’ vote. But why exactly has a vote on the peculiarities of Italy’s uncharacteristic parliamentary system become a – perhaps exaggerated – proxy vote on Italy’s membership of the Euro-Zone? 
$$$$
What’s the story so far?
$$$$
April 2014 - Italy is ‘the sick man of Europe’, facing a host of deep-seated economic and fiscal problems. The energetic young Prime Minister Matteo Renzi wants to introduce legislation aimed at strengthening the stalling economy. But he complains that the country’s peculiar ‘perfect bicameralism’ parliamentary system, where both houses of parliament – the Senate and the Chamber – have the exact same powers, is hindering his proposed economic reforms. This system was brought about in the aftermath of the Fascist era under Benito Mussolini and was deliberately designed with a host of checks and balances in place to restrict the abuse of democratic power. 
$$$$
His solution? He and his centre-left Democratic Party introduce a bill to the Senate proposing amending the Italian constitution to make it easier for the government to pass laws. The reforms would substantially decrease the membership and power of the Senate. Renzi stakes his political career on the vote, promising to resign if there’s a ‘no’ vote. 
$$$$
October 2015 - The bill receives its first approval in Senate.
$$$$
January 11, 2016- The bill receives its first approval in the Chamber.
$$$$
January 20, 2016 - The bill receives its second approval in the Senate.
$$$$
April 2016 - The bill receives its second approval in the Chamber. However, the constitutional amendment was not approved by a two-thirds majority of two-thirds in each house of the Parliament and a referendum is called.
$$$$
It will be the third constitutional referendum in Italy’s history. A vote to give the regions more power was approved in 2001. In 2006, proposals by the Silvio Berlusconi government to give more powers to the Prime Minister were rejected by 61.3% of voters. 
$$$$
June 23, 2016 - Brexit. In the UK, 51.9% of Brits vote to leave the European Union. Markets had widely anticipated a vote to remain in the 28-nation bloc. The British Pound slumps to a 31-year low versus the Dollar following the vote, its biggest one-day loss in history. The Euro gains on the Pound, but EUR/USD falls from 1.14242 to 1.09119 on the day of the vote indicating the market’s concern that the UK may not be the only country that ultimately leaves a European economic alliance. That in turn amplifies the concern of populism rising in Europe to threaten the EU and the Euro-zone that anchors the common currency.
$$$$
July 2016- The Italian vote is now seen as the next concentrated source of political risk in the Euro-Zone. Analysts say the referendum is the ""single biggest risk on the European political landscape. An opinion poll shows that Five Star has overtaken Renzi’s Democratic Party to become the country’s most popular group. Five Star wants to hold a referendum on Italian membership of the euro, as do other main political parties in Italy. The media invents its next epithet: ‘Quitaly’. Investors begin toshow unease in the country’s assetsget spooked. Italian bonds are under-performing their Spanish peers for the first time in a year. 
$$$$
November 2, 2016 - Donald Trump beats the odds to be elected the next US President. Markets fear the Italy vote could, after Brexit and Trump, mark a third win for the ‘populist explosion’.
$$$$
So what happens if there’s a ‘no’ vote?
$$$$
A last look at the polls before the current blackout period showed the ‘No’ vote ahead, although the large ‘undecided’ contingent could still swing the vote the other way. Expectations for a ‘No’ vote on Sunday have already seen a range of Italian assets slump. If Renzi resigns and Five Star gains power through potentially difficult-to-establish alliances, its leadership has said it would hold a referendum to decide whether Italy should leave the Euro-Zone. Some analysts even fear that the threat of this key member leaving could put us on a path to the eventual breakup of the entire European Union. 
$$$$
The Italian banking system also hangs in the balance. Italian bank shares have been on a one-way trip over the last few months, with losses accelerating in the past few weeks. Investors are worried that if PM Renzi resigns, his proposed bank bailout may be scrapped, leaving the Italian financial system facing heightened risks. As is currently seen in the weak British Pound ahead of the UK government triggering Article 50 by the end of March 2017, markets can treat uncertainty harshly. 
$$$$
And if the Italian banking system faces a crisis, so does the rest of the European banking system. Beleagured Banca Monte dei Pashi di Sienna shares have nearly halved in just over a month, while the 10-year Italian bond yield has jumped nearly 60 basis point to 2.05% over the same time frame as investors demand more yield for their money. The Euro in contrast has fallen from around EUR/USD 1.10 to 1.06, though that move is in part due to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting where a fed fund rate hike fully priced in at the December 14 FOMC meeting.
$$$$
And what happens if there’s a ‘yes’ vote
$$$$
If a ‘Yes’ vote prevails on Sunday, a bounce back in Italian assets and the Euro is expected, but this may just be kicking the can down the road. Reform via the specific 47 articles (of 139) in the Constitution does not halt the rise of populist discontent, solve banking system strains or recharge lackluster economic growth. Further, an election in Austria, also on Sunday, threatens a victory for the first far-right head of state in Western Europe since the Second World War.
$$$$
There are also elections in the Netherlands, France and Germany all coming up next year, again heightening the political uncertainty in the Euro area.
$$$$
What time does it all start?
$$$$
The vote is on Sunday December 4. Provisional turnout results will come in around 07:00 GMT. The first exit polls will appear around 10:00 GMT. Currency markets in Asia open at 18:00 GMT on Sunday. The final result of the vote will start to come in around 01:00 GMT (02.00 AM local) on the morning of Monday December 5. The Italian bond market and stock market open at 07:00 AM and 08:00 (06:00 and 07:00 GMT) respectively.

British Pound May Mostly Overlook UK Inflation Uptick	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2016/12/13/British-Pound-May-Mostly-Overlook-UK-Inflation-Uptick.html	1481609220	"
British Pound may not finding lasting direction in UK CPI figures
$$$$
ZEW survey likely to pass with little fanfare on limited ECB impact
$$$$
Japanese Yen down in quiet Asian trade as Nikkei recovers losses
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
November’s UK CPI report headlines the economic data docket in European trading hours. The headline inflation rate is expected to rise to 1.1 percent, the highest since October 2014. An upbeat result may offer a near-term boost to the British Pound but significant follow-through seems unlikely absent a dramatic deviation from consensus forecasts.
$$$$
The Bank of England has made it quite plain that it intends to look though a pickup in price growth driven by Sterling weakness following the Brexit referendum. Governor Mark Carney and company have pledged not to sit idly by if the economy heats up too dramatically but with inflation well short of the 2 percent target, that seems like at most a distant threat. 
$$$$
The German ZEW Survey of analyst sentiment may likewise pass with relatively little fanfare. Sentiment is projected to improve a bit but the implications of such an outcome for ECB policy are virtually nil after the central bank extended its QE effort through the end of next year. As such, the near-term Euro impact ought to be modest unless fears of cooling amid post-Brexit vote uncertainty deliver a harsh disappointment.
$$$$
The Japanese Yen underperformed in otherwise quiet overnight trade. The perennial anti-risk currency declined as the Nikkei 225 stock benchmark edged upward, erasing early-session losses to post a narrow gain on the day.

Euro May Have Further to Fall as Draghi Keeps Markets Guessing	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2016/10/25/Euro-May-Have-Further-to-Fall-as-Draghi-Keeps-Markets-Guessing.html	1477416300	"
The ECB President continues to keep the markets wondering whether its bond-buying program will be tapered or extended
$$$$
Mario Draghi gave little further insight into Eurozone monetary policy in a speech in Berlin
$$$$
Without a timetable for Taper, Euro will struggle to regain ground
"	"
Talking points:
$$$$
See the DailyFX Analysts' 4Q forecasts for the Dollar, Euro, Pound, Equities and Gold in the DailyFX Trading Guides page.
$$$$
There was little to lift the Euro in the latest speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, suggesting its losses against the dollar could well continue. The ECB President, in a lecture in Berlin, said he “would certainly prefer not to have to keep interest rates at such low levels for an excessively long time, since the unwelcome side-effects may accumulate over time.” He added: “We should seek to create the conditions for a return of interest rates to higher levels.”
$$$$
However, there was no indication that rates or the pace of stimulus will be cut soon – in line with his comments last Thursday after the ECB Governing Council decided to leave all its key interest rates unchanged and its asset-purchase program at €80 billion per month. The program is intended to run until the end of March 2017, or beyond if necessary. At last week’s policy meeting, Draghi gave no indication that the program will either be tapered – reduced – or extended beyond March. Instead, he implied that the markets will have to wait until the next gathering (December 8th) for any clarity on intention and that tapering will begin before the ECB cuts Eurozone interest rates.
$$$$
Against this background, there seems little to stop committed EUR/USD decline. The pair has been in a declining channel on the daily chart since late September. Over that period it has fallen from highs around 1.1250 to its current level around 1.0850, marking one of the most aggressive slides this year. Unless the fundamental winds shift, there is therefore little to prevent EUR/USD from easing further until it reaches the February and March lows around 1.0820 and then the January lows close to 1.0710.
$$$$
Fundamentally, the Eurozone economic outlook remains weak despite news on Tuesday that Germany’s Ifo business climate index improved unexpectedly in October. That suggests there’s little room for tapering the asset-purchase program even though Eurozone inflation is at its highest for level in two years and inflation expectations have further risen.
$$$$
However, short positions in the Euro continued to rise ahead of the ECB’s October meeting, according to the latest Commitments of Traders report from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As a contrarian indicator, that leaves open the risk of a sharp rise in EUR/USD if it starts to firm and traders are forced to cover their open short positions.

EUR/USD Turns Lower after US ISM Manufacturing Beats	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2016/10/03/EURUSD-Turns-Lower-after-US-ISM-Manufacturing-Beats.html	1475506680	"

Talking Points:
$$$$
- US ISM Manufacturing rises to 51.5 from 49.4 versus 50.4 expected.
$$$$
- EUR/USD slides after U.S. factory output claws back into positive terrain.
$$$$
- See the DailyFX economic calendar for the week of October 2 to October 7.
$$$$
Factory output clawed back into expansionary territory in September after contracting for the first time in six months in August the Institute of Supply Management reported earlier suggesting the previous pull-back may have been temporary in nature and caused by the flooding in Louisiana and wildfires in the West. 
$$$$
The agency said that its September Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 from 49.4, significantly above market expectations of 50.4. As a reminder, a print below 50 in the ISM Index indicates contraction in the manufacturing economy. 
$$$$
The report breakdown showed that ISM Prices Paid remained unchanged at 53.0 while ISM New Orders surged to 55.1 from 49.1. Meanwhile, Employment rose to 49.7 from 48.3 but continued in negative terrain signaling demand for manufactured products remain soft for which employers in the sector do not feel the need to accelerate hiring. 
$$$$
The September Jobs report, however, continues to be the focal point of the week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release Non-Farm Payroll numbers on Friday. As of today, the market expects to see +173K in new jobs following a +151K print in August. Strong jobs gains will provide evidence that the U.S. Labor Market continues to improve and could embolden the Fed to ramp up its hawkish narrative paving the way for a 25bps interest rate hike in December.

EUR/USD Higher after July EZ Consumer Confidence Falls Less than Forecast	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2016/07/20/EURUSD-Higher-after-July-EZ-Consumer-Confidence-Falls-Less-than-Forecast.html	1469027400	"
EUR July (Advance): -7.9 versus -8.0% expected, from a revised print of -7.2 in June.
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
- EZ July Consumer Confidence falls to -7.9 from -7.2 in June vs expectations of -8.0.
$$$$
- EUR/USD rises after the advanced July Confidence Report but lacks traction to hold gains ahead of the ECB. 
$$$$
- Avoid the pitfalls of trading by steering clear of classic mistakes. Review these principles in the ""Traits of Successful Traders"" series.
$$$$
Consumer confidence deteriorated in July within the Euro Area, the European Commission said on Wednesday. The advance July report showed that sentiment continued downtrending and fell to -7.9 from -7.2 June in the wake of the Brexit Referendum vote that created tremendous uncertainty about the future of the economic bloc. The reading, however, topped market expectations slightly that called for a decline to -8.0. 
$$$$
The UK decision to leave to EU has undoubtedly clouded the economic outlook for the region and that can be reflected in consumer expectations that continues to deteriorate. As a result of the Brexit fallout, it is likely confidence indicators will remain depressed thereby curtailing consumer spending and business investment; ultimately limiting economic activity and slowing the convergence of inflation to the target in the region.

$$$$
The Euro was little changed versus the other major currencies (at the time this report was written) after today’s Euro-Zone’s GDP figures came slightly below expectations. According to preliminary estimates by Eurostat, Euro-Zone’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in the Q1 of 2016, below the prior and expected figure of 0.6%. The year-on-year change in GDP was 1.5%, which was below the prior and expected 1.6% figure. 
$$$$
As was mentioned by DailyFX Chief Currency Strategist John Kicklighter, a lot of eyes were put on the GDP figures coming from Greece today, as the numbers might help understand the pressure for an agreement with creditors as the country struggles with debt and growth conditions. 
$$$$
Greek GDP came at -0.40% QoQ, which was not as bad as the expected -0.70%, but below the prior +0.10%. The year-on-year non-seasonally adjusted figure came at -1.30%, better than the -1.40% expected, but below the -0.70% prior figure.
$$$$
Greece is trying to negotiate new funding, and is due to repay the IMF approximately €650 million in June and about €2.3 billion to the ECB on July 20.
$$$$
Previously, the IMF and the European policy makers were not able to agree whether Greece would be able to meet the budget surplus target set under the original bailout agreement. Under the EU program, Greece is supposed to post a fiscal surplus before interest payments of 3.5% of GDP within two years.
$$$$
Coming into today, the figures were seen as having broad implication, but lacking in “market moving” ability. Taking this into consideration, it seems the figures coming slightly below expectations were not a sufficient catalyst for directional conviction, and the Euro was little changed versus other major currencies.
$$$$
Meanwhile, the DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index (SSI) is showing that about 41.7% of FXCM’s traders are long the EUR/USD at the time of writing. The SSI is a contrarian indicator, implying further EUR/USD strength ahead.

The Euro was little changed versus the US Dollar (at the time this report was written) after today's Eurozone economic confidence figures came below expectations, declining to the lowest level since February 2015. The Economic Sentiment Indicator fell to 103.0, below the expected 103.8 figure and the prior revised reading of 103.9. The index is compiled from five different indicator surveys including: industrial, services, consumer, retail, and construction. The report said that the deterioration in sentiment was due to lower confidence among consumers as well as managers in the services and construction sectors. Sentiment in the services sector dropped to 9.6 in March from a revised 10.8 print in February, and was below the expected 10.8. Consumer confidence fell to -9.7 as a consequence of growing pessimism among consumers about the future general economic situation. Measures for industrial confidence declined slightly to -4.2 from the revised prior -4.1 as managers’ expectations for production and the current level of orders remained almost unchanged. 
$$$$
The ECB will start to increase bond purchases to 80 billion euros from the prior 60 billion euros this Friday after announcing new stimulus measures earlier this month. As was mentioned recently by DailyFX Chief Currency Strategist John Kicklighter, central banks are steering monetary policy in an effort to bolster confidence, with stimulus by the ECB aimed to reach economic objectives; 2% inflation, or slightly lower, in the ECB’s case. The central bank seems to be in a wait-and-see modeafter the latest policy announcement, which may hint that the market saw the figures as having limited impact on possible monetary policy actions, and the Euro was little changed versus the US Dollar.

The Euro traded sideways to slightly lower versus other major currencies (at the time this report was written) after today’s Euro-Zone GDP figures came in line with expectations. According to preliminary estimates by Eurostat, Euro-Zone’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in Q4 of 2015, as the prior and expected figure. The year-on-year change in GDP was 1.5%, below the prior 1.6%, but in line with expectations as well. 
$$$$
Germany, which is the largest economy in the Euro-Zone, showed a 0.3% QoQ expansion in figures released earlier today. Perhaps most notable was the -0.6% seasonally adjusted Q4 print from Greece, that signaled the country slipped back into recession. Yet with ‘risk trends’ the major driving factor in the markets right now, and the figures coming generally in line with expectations, the Euro kept trading with the prevailing market theme.

Find key turning points for the EUR/USD with DailyFX SSI
$$$$
In the most recent FOMC minutes, multiple members saw increased downside risk and uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook and global growth. These worries can be accredited to the continuing decline in global equities, as well as low energy prices. 
$$$$
Lower energy prices are bringing up questions of economic stability for a number of countries and the potential harm to global growth that turmoil there could entail. Along with energy prices, countries like Japan and China continue to be seen as stability risks. Thus the risk from global markets remains an important factor for the Fed to consider as it decides the direction of future policy. 
$$$$
However, despite the more cautious outlook, domestic growth indicators provided some confidence at the January meeting. Areas such as housing, job growth and labor utilization showed signs of continued strength. These economic growth indicators are key gauges that the Fed as it considers the pace of its rate hike path. The importance of these measures to the Fed does not necessarily translate equally to the marketshowever. 
$$$$
One of the most important indicators for the Fed is inflation, and the meeting minutes release stressed the effect that low energy prices are having on headline price growth. Despite this, medium term inflation expectations were little changed and the Fed is confident of its ability to foster inflation growth to reach its 2% target. The core inflation rate is currently at 2.1 percent. However, the Fed’s preferred core PCE measure is markedly lower at 1.4.
$$$$
With regards to future rate hikes, the committee maintained its cautious outlook and affirmed that it remains data-dependent. For their part, the markets no longer expect policymakers to tighten further in 2016, according to the priced-in outlook implied in Fed Funds futures contracts. Today’s release did not offer clear-cut push back against this consensus view, which perhaps explains why the US Dollar did not react in a meaningful way.

$$$$
The Euro traded lower versus the US Dollar (at the time this report was written) after today’s ECB Meeting Minutes reaffirmed the possibility for further easing at the next policy meeting. In their latest January policy meeting, the ECB kept policy unchanged with asset purchases remaining at a pace of €60 billion per month until March 2017, with main rate at 0.05% and the deposit rate at negative -0.30%. The decision to keep policy unchanged came after the central bank provided further stimulus at the December meeting, which led to a surge in the Euro, presumably due to the bank not meeting market expectations for more aggressive measures. 
$$$$
Looking in to the January account of the meeting, the bank emphasized risks stemming from china, emerging markets and lower commodity prices, which caused risk aversion in the markets. The bank said that the sharp decline in oil prices had significantly dampened the inflation outlook for 2016 in the euro area, which could turn negative for a number of months. Furthermore, the ECB expressed concerns over the outlook for external demand due to weakening global growth. While the bank emphasized that current monetary policy is working, downside risks had increased from the start of the year, which would require the bank to review, and possibly reconsider, the monetary policy stance at March when new macroeconomic projections would be available. The bank reaffirmed that policy rates would remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time, and that there is a range of policy options in order to achieve a rate close to, but below 2% inflation.
$$$$
As was mentioned today by DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak, the market has been on the lookout for clues on possible expansion of stimulus at the March meeting. The Euro has been selling off since the start of the European session, perhaps in anticipation for further clues on stimulus. The comments in the meeting seemed to at least reaffirm the possibility for further measures, and the Euro traded lower versus the US Dollar.

Risk Takes a Dive After Terrible NFP Report	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/10/02/Market-Talk-10-2-2015.html	1443794760	"
Friday’s NFP report was terrible. Across-the-board. Raising red flags towards the ‘recovery’ in the United States. 
$$$$
Long Yen remains a favored ‘safe-haven’ candidate should risk aversion continue to increase; particularly against USD and commodity currencies such as AUD, NZD, or CAD. 
$$$$
Short EUR/USD is attractive for ‘risk-on’ themes, as the expected monetary policy dichotomy between the two represented economies could continue for a while should normalcy be restored. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. So, NFP was bad: As in, real bad.This was the worst NFP report of 2015. Non-Farm Payrolls in the United States printed at 142K jobs added to American Non-Farm payrolls, and this was far below the expectation of 200k. But the bad news didn’t end there – wage growth disappointed, and this has been one of the driving forces behind the ambition of the Federal Reserve to raise rates. This disappointing wage growth makes the prospect of a 2015 rate hike even less likely; and despite the fact that Federal Reserve officials continue to talk up a rate-hike towards the end of this year, markets are becoming less and less convinced that they’ll actually do anything after five years of more of the same.  
$$$$
More than anything, this huge miss highlights how the global slowdown and accompanying market turmoil have landed in the United States; and one of the few bright spots in the global economy is now a little more-dim. This just continues to chip away at the confidence of the American ‘recovery’ that many have debated the efficacy of throughout 2015.  
$$$$
Today’s report also came with downward revisions to last month’s NFP, which originally printed at +173k jobs added was revised down to +136k. The unemployment rate stayed unchanged at 5.1%, but Labor Force Participation, one of the key factors diminishing the ‘health’ seen in the labor market during the recovery, has fallen to a 38-year-low at 62.4%.  
$$$$
The immediate reaction across markets has been brutal. Stocks sold off near-immediately, and risk aversion swept through commodity, bond, and FX markets around-the-world.  This provided a super-charged move to USD/JPY and EUR/USD, as USD-weakness permeated through major FX-markets. I know what you’re thinking – if this is legitimate risk-aversion, shouldn’t the US Dollar be getting stronger on ‘safe-haven flows?’ Well, in a normal environment, absolutely. But what we’re in right now is anything but normal. The past six years have been ‘extraordinarily accommodative’ environments from Central Banks around-the-world. Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) combined with multiple stimulus efforts have distorted markets. This is why outlandish events like Spanish debt yielding less than that of the United States have happened this year. In a normal environment, credit quality will denominate how much interest you have to pay (much like how one’s credit score determines how low of a rate they can get on a credit card); but earlier this year we saw an economy that was teetering on the brinks of danger just two years ago trading with a tighter yield than the United States.  
$$$$
After stimulus and QE programs in Europe and Japan drove many investors and traders to use those low-yielding currencies to fund trading positions; continued uncertainty along with diminished hopes of a rate hike from the United States have created an ‘un-wind’ situation in these key markets.  One might make the assertion that Euro is a ‘safe-haven’ by observing its strength in the midst of a risk-off move; but this would be a mistake.  Only four months ago we were talking about dissolution scenarios for Europe and the prospect of it ‘all-of-the-sudden’ becoming a safe-haven 
$$$$
So, this environment is anything but normal. This is quantitative tightening, and the continued banter from the Federal Reserve about kicking rates higher while much of the world dwindles in the economic doldrums is likely the source of the current concern. As we discussed post-FOMC, it appears as though Global Markets are Losing Confidence in the Fed.

2. Want to play ‘risk-off,’ look to the Long Yen: this continues to be one of the more attractive themes across markets for playing risk-aversion or risk-off types of movements. And the reason behind this isn’t just the ‘unwind’ theory mentioned above, but should risk-aversion continue to increase in the global environment there are good odds that we’ll have a wider movement in the Yen than the Euro. One of the big reasons for this is the length of the QE-program leading to current day. Europe began their program last year, and Japan has been in this since 2012. USDJPY made a +50% movement after Shinzo Abe and ‘Abenomics’ drove Japanese markets, while EUR/USD is ~25-30% off of the highs from last year. So, comparably the Yen has more to lose here as ‘unwind’ sweeps through markets on this risk-aversion run. 
$$$$
But perhaps more interesting than that is what happened in 2008 during the last financial crisis; as USD/JPY moved from 123 in June of 2007 to 75 in October of 2011. So, during the last financial crisis while risk-aversion was sweeping the globe, the Yen took on safe-haven preference to the US Dollar; and this makes sense considering the prospect of Japanese investors ‘repatriating’ funds back into Japan after investing internationally to seek out higher-yielding products while facing an extremely low-yielding environment in Japan.  
$$$$
On top of this, China is facing intense pressure; and as Japan is a key trading partner of China and as it’s largely expected that China will devalue the Yuan in an effort to offset the headwinds of recession, Japan becomes vulnerable. As the Yuan depreciates, it will be more expensive for Japanese exporters to sell products in a very key market. It also makes imports from China cheaper, thereby dampening domestic demand for domestic products.  
$$$$
These forces together can make the Yen one of the more attractive safe-haven vehicles should risk-aversion increase, as carry trades unwind and as Japanese investors repatriate funds that were previously lodged into international investments, while China continues to face weakness along with the rest-of-the-world. 
$$$$
A big level is currently ‘in-play’ on USD/JPY at 119. In the below chart, we’re looking at Volume at price, and this is the number of traders that are already in the market with the approximate price, along with the side of the market that they’re on. As you can see, 119 is a huge level that has a massive amount of interest behind it. This is also the level we had mentioned as a ‘line-in-the-sand’ for risk-aversion in USD/JPY. If you would like to stay updated on Volume at Price as it’s published each week, you can join David Rodriguez distribution list to be notified when he publishes this each Tuesday: David’s distribution list for Volume at Price.

3. Want to play ‘risk-on,’ look to Short EUR/USD: One of the more attractive areas should this panic dissipate, and should markets begin trending higher, again, would be the short EUR/USD position.  The reason behind this attractiveness is the fact that the pair has traded higher as carry trades have unwound, giving the pair more room to fall; and also given the fundamental direction of each economy represented by the pair. 
$$$$
Just earlier this week, Europe posted a deflationary print; which indicates that more QE may be coming down the road after Mr. Mario Draghi assured markets that the bank could expand their program if need-be. Meanwhile the United States is looking at higher rates, whether it’s in Q1 or 2 of 2016 or later this year. Europe is expected to loosen policy while the United States tightens; offering a clear delineation between these two currencies should normalcy be restored.  
$$$$
Timing this type of stuff can be difficult, but as suggested in the article Is the Euro Down-Trend Ready for Resumption, we looked at using sentiment and positioning of retail traders to filter opportunity to the short side of the trade.  This is what we call ‘SSI’ at DailyFX, or the ‘Speculative Sentiment Index.’  This is a real-time outlay of where real FX traders are positioned at on FXCM platforms, and once retail traders move to a ‘net-long’ position, the short-side could become increasingly attractive.

Stocks Rally to Close Out a Brutal Quarter	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/30/market-talk-9-30-2015.html	1443613800	"
Equity markets are rallying to close out a tough quarter that’s seen $11 Trillion of value erased from global bourses. 
$$$$
Europe reported negative inflation, now joining Japan in the ‘deflation’ category; and raising the prospect of additional easing measures in the future. 
$$$$
The Economic Calendar is loaded for the remainder of the week – expect significant volatility ahead. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Most equity markets are up thus far on the day, after a rough start to the week and an end to one of the most brutal quarters in years. An estimated $11 Trillion has been wiped away from global equities over the past three months, with China taking the lead with $5 Trillion lost from their stock markets. The Shanghai Composite has lost 29% since the end of June, and after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to the United States last week in which he made multiple statements committing the country to ‘market-based reforms,’ many believe that the state-sponsored buying of stocks that was accused of stemming the declines may have run its course. Xi made mention that Chinese stocks have entered a phase of ‘self-recovery,’ which may be signaling that policy makers are done with stimulus measures, at least for now.  
$$$$
The source of global weakness has not been just China, as the Euro Stoxx 600 lost 9% over the quarter, and in the coming months we’ll likely see pressure from a variety of venues. Namely the spread of ‘slowdown’ throughout Asian, and continued weakness in commodities; as we looked at yesterday, the continued slump in commodity prices can have huge impact inside of many companies and economies.  
$$$$
Earnings season in the US kicks off next week when Alcoa reports on October the 8th, and this is pivotal for the stock market as this is a direct implication of corporate health (and stock prices). Corporate earnings in the US have been the one consistent bright spot in the economy over the past 4-5 years, and with dramatically lower commodity prices we’re likely going to see companies with exposure to China or Commodities report below expectations. The ramifications of these earnings misses can be huge, especially on the inflation and employment-front as companies that are losing money (or making less than they expected) will usually look to pare back growth strategies. If companies foresee a downturn in the economy, they’ll usually pivot with a more risk-averse strategy and this can create a cascade effect throughout markets as the fear of a recession creates more losses than an actual recession would on its own.  
$$$$
On days such as today, in which quarters or months end, we can often see trend-reversion moves based on portfolio and hedge fund managers ‘squaring up’ their positions; meaning – if you were running a portfolio and you had a juicy gain in an S&P 500 short position, you can close out the short position (square up) and report the gain to your investors. Then the very act of prices moving up means that short-position holders are ‘squeezed’ as prices move against their profitable short positions, and this could create even more buying demand on quarter or month-end days.  
$$$$
So trend-following can be challenging when chasing a trend on the last day of a quarter (or month); but could present some fine opportunities in the coming days to sell at higher prices (or buy at lower). In the chart below, we’re looking at the S&P 500 with potential support and resistance levels; and if you want a more-interactive version of the chart, click on the image and you’ll be able to follow along as price action develops. 
$$$$
2. Euro inflation disappoints: Inflation for the Euro-zone printed negative in September at -.1%, driven by falling energy prices that have slid -8.9% from a year earlier. This joins the deflationary print that we saw from Japan last week to add to the global inflation-envy. The only countries that are seeing > 2% inflation right now are the ones that can least afford it, like Brazil, Argentina or Venezuela. Meanwhile QE has bounced deflation from Japan, to Europe, back to Japan, and now to both Europe and Japan.  
$$$$
This continued lack of inflationary pressure despite QE being turned-on at full speed has led many analysts to expect additional easing from both economies. Both Europe and Japan are heavily committed to Central Bank bond-buying, and if they want to attain they’re 2% targets, they’re likely going to need to do something more.  
$$$$
The ECB has already mentioned that they could expand the program if necessary; and the Bank of Japan has made allusions to, but no direct mentions of the same. The bigger question is ‘how.’ The Bank of Japan is already monetizing every bond that they print; so many questions arise around future easing for the country.  
$$$$
While this raises multiple uncertainties, it does bring in a few attractive trade concepts. 1) The Yen could be one of the more-attractive ‘safe-haven’ currencies should panic in the global economy continue to increase. This would be the unwind of carry trades that have driven USD/JPY from sub-80 to ~120. That’s a 50% movement in a currency pair, and if the Bank of Japan doesn’t open the door for additional easing in the future, there is little reason for traders to continue supporting the position.  
$$$$
If we do get stability across global financial markets in the coming weeks, the down-trend in EUR/USD may be ready for resumption. In a normal environment, the short EUR/USD theme is a very attractive position because of the dichotomous direction of each of these economies. The US is slowly and slowly seeing signs of growth and inflationary pressures, to the point where the Federal Reserve wants to kick off the first rate hike in over nine years; while the European Central Bank is battling deflation and slower growth while their QE program is kicking at full-speed.  
$$$$
For right now, EUR/USD continues working on a bear-flag formation after setting the low in March of this year. But as we discussed in our previous article on the EUR/USD down-trend, traders can wait for a flip in sentiment or a break of the flag to signal trend-resumption.  
$$$$

$$$$
This week is far from over: Non-Farm Payrolls has a tendency to monopolize the calendar during NFP-weeks, but this week is especially loaded. We’re going to get a lot of Fed-speak. Later today we have Brainard, Bullard and Yellen speaking in St. Louis, and William Dudley in New York. This is the same William Dudley that gave commentary in October of last year and on August 25/26 that turned around massive declines in equity markets. He did this by essentially remaining balanced, which some Fed members seem to be having some difficulty with for their on-air interviews.  
$$$$
We also get Chinese manufacturing PMI later tonight, and this can be a huge data point. After Monday’s huge miss, expect markets to focus on this print even more-so than usual. The fear is that the slowdown in China is ‘harder’ than many had hoped or thought; and should this number print below the 49.7 expectation (below-50 indicates contraction), expect some degree of panic to find its way back into equity markets, as peripheral-Asian economies will likely get hit hard from additional evidence of a more-aggressive Chinese slowdown. Later tomorrow we get ISM Manufacturing out of the United States, and Friday brings on the big NFP report.  
$$$$
As always – keep the risk light. No one trade will make your career, but any one trade can certainly break it.

Markets on Edge Ahead of Heavy Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/10/01/market-talk-10-1-2015.html	1443703080	"
Equity markets are holding on to gains from yesterday’s Quarter & Month-End price action. 
$$$$
A heavy slate of data over the next 24 hours could change matters significantly. 
$$$$
Going into Q4, the most attractive strategies are continued wagers on monetary policy direction from the United States, Europe and Japan.  
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Most equity markets around the world are starting off the day’s price action by holding on to gains from yesterday.As mentioned in yesterday’s piece, price action marked the end of the 3rd quarter and the month of September, and this can often bring reversals in trends as traders look to close-up positions ahead of the quarter/month-end. And we saw quite a bit of trend-reversal yesterday, with markets in the United States, and Europe, and most markets in Asia trading higher after a brutal quarter that saw over $11 Trillion of value wiped away in global equity.  
$$$$
The biggest losses for Q3 were out of China, where more than $5 Trillion of value was erased; and going into the 4th quarter this remains a sensitive pressure-point of the global economy. The big question is how ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ the Chinese slowdown may be. Shockingly disappointing reports earlier in the week, combined with a negative raft of data over the past three months give the appearance that China may be heading for more of a ‘hard landing’ than a soft one, and this raises the stakes for the global economy as this harder-than-expected slowdown is creating a domino-effect throughout Asia and into Europe.  
$$$$
Just last week we saw Japan post another deflationary print, and ironically this was on the same day that Ms. Janet Yellen reaffirmed the Fed’s desire to hike interest rates in 2015.  And just yesterday we discussed the deflationary print that showed up in Europe, as the European Central Bank grapples with a lack of growth despite a QE-program that’s running at full speed. This raises the prospect for an increase in the program, and at the last ECB meeting Mr. Mario Draghi indicated that the bank could expand the program if needed.  
$$$$
Going into Q4, it’s the prospect of more QE from these economies that could produce some of the more attractive trade setups. 
$$$$
For Europe and the EUR/USD, expect bad European news to bring weakness in the Euro, as a direct correlation develops between negativity and increased QE-expectations. However, if we get ‘panic’ coming in markets similar to ‘Black Monday’ in China on 8/24 – expect EUR/USD to strengthen as previously-opened carry trades unwind. So, for EUR/USD – bad European news while stability is in markets should bring on weakness as traders anticipate additional QE and play the monetary policy dichotomy in the pair. But if it’s a panic-type of situation, expect EUR/USD to strengthen. 
$$$$
As we discussed previously, one way that traders could look to time a short-side EUR/USD entry is by using market sentiment.  This has produced some pretty attractive timing-based entries in EUR/USD over the past 12 months: 
$$$$

$$$$
2. One of the more questionable themes going into Q4 is the tone of the US Dollar: As we’ve seen continued jostling around that first rate hike from the Fed in over nine years, we’ve seen the US Dollar put in a roller-coaster type of ride over the past couple of months. I wish that I could give you a price action formation or a candlestick setup that could explain this price action, but there are none that I know of. We’ve essentially seen the dollar trade along with Fed commentary, which can always be difficult to quantify. As the Fed’s backed off of hiking rates at the September meeting, or decreased expectations for quicker rate-hikes, we’ve seen the Dollar weaken-off only to strengthen back up as more hawkish members of the Fed espouse a more aggressive rate-hike plan.  
$$$$
Expect the US Dollar to continue trading along-side expectations for that first hike from the Fed: As the prospects of a hike become more certain, expect the dollar to strengthen as bets increase for that first rate hike. As panic comes into the global economy, and as more signs of weakness or slowdown show up, expect the US Dollar to weaken as those rate-bets unwind. 
$$$$
This is the exact opposite of what most traders would expect, as the US Dollar is still very much a ‘safe-haven’ currency that should see strength on the back of panic or risk aversion; but with the Fed walking towards this first rate hike, matters in USD have become obscured to the point that it’s trading diametrically-opposite of what one would expect.  
$$$$
For now – the US Dollar is sitting in a strong area of resistance that’s held for the past couple of months in the Greenback. Breaking below 12,050 and then 12,000 could open the door for short-USD positions, while breaks above 12,100 could open the door for additional USD-strength.  
$$$$

$$$$
3. Bank of Japan sees little need to increase QE just yet: As mentioned in point #1 – the primary drivers of trends in the currency market will likely be based-around additional QE expectations. As mentioned previously, the European Central Bank has already said that they’ll expand the program as needed; and reading the initial signs of data, it looks like that will be coming sooner-rather-than-later.  
$$$$
But Japan is in a slightly different spot, as they’ve been heavily invested in QE for over three years now, and their economy is still showing signs of deflation and slowing growth. Just this morning, Bank of Japan officials went on record as saying that they see little need to add to their stimulus program at their policy meeting this month on October 6-7.  
$$$$
With lower-probabilities of additional QE out of Japan in the immediate future, this increases the Yen’s attractiveness as a ‘safe-haven’ candidate should risk-aversion or ‘panic’ themes find their way back into markets. 
$$$$
Right now, price action on USD/JPY is carving out a rather consistent symmetrical-wedge pattern; and since the launch of Abe-nomics at the end of 2012, these wedge formations have preceded big moves in USD/JPY. The chart below highlights a couple of the more visible wedges that we’ve seen over the past couple of years, and with the stakes raised across global markets – expect this wedge to break in one direction or the other in the coming quarter.

Welcome to the Consequences of ZIRP	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/10/06/Market-Talk-10-6-2015.html	1444136520	"
Global equity markets are continuing to hold on to gains after the NFP-fueled rally of last Friday, as markets are kicking out expectations for rate hikes from the Fed. 
$$$$
The Fed hasn’t yet backed off of a 2015 rate-hike, and with numerous Fed members set to speak in the coming days, the ‘risk-on’ rally since last week could reverse quickly. 
$$$$
Many correlated-setups continue to exist, but one of the clearest trading-themes is the continued stance on additional QE from Europe and Japan.  
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Global stock markets continue to rally in the wake of Friday’s abysmal NFP report. The prevailing thought being that with a slowdown in job growth (further evidenced on Friday), the Federal Reserve will likely back off of the 2015 rate hike that they’ve been talking about for over three years. Since Friday’s NFP report, we’ve seen expectations for a hike at the October and December meetings of this year fall dramatically, and expectations are now falling for March and moving deeper into 2016. And this meets directly with the fact that, in general, the Fed has had a tendency not to hike in election years (which next year is) and this may actually kick that first rate hike all the way out to 2017.  
$$$$
But this massive rally on the back of, what essentially is ‘bad news’ on the employment front, is exactly the type of ‘excessive risk taking’ that the Federal Reserve was looking to offset when talking up this rate hike earlier in the year (and in previous years). With ZIRP keeping interest rates in many investment classes extremely low, investors had a dearth of options to choose from when doing retirement planning or portfolio management. This leads investors to hold onto heavier allocations of stocks in their portfolios, which in a bull market that’s being fully-supported by the Federal Reserve might not be such a bad thing.  
$$$$
But as the Fed begins to pull that support – and on the other side – as soon as interest rates start to creep higher – that situation changes dramatically. The investor can now get a higher rate in a fixed-income investment; and the volatility in stock markets could mean that the nice, stable return seen over the past five years becomes jagged and dangerous with the potential for heavy losses. This leads to significantly-less incentive to ‘buy the dip,’ as the Federal Reserve is looking to tighten policy by moving interest rates higher. And when combined with an Asian-slowdown, continued weakness in Europe and an outsized-slump in commodity prices, the risks of carrying a heavy stock allocation are, arguably, higher than they’ve been at any point in the past five years (when the Fed was explicitly supporting markets with ‘extraordinary accommodation’). 
$$$$
But are we at the point where the Fed is going to take a 2015 rate-hike off-of-the-table? We don’t know that yet – all that we have is evidence as to why they should (based on the general economist’s point-of-view) and what markets are expecting. But market expectations have been divorced from the Federal Reserve’s expectations for some time now. On the dot-plot projections, some Fed members are forecasting as many as four rate hikes for next year alone. The forward guidance that the Federal Reserve has instituted as a ‘transparency measure’ in 2011 with the goal of helping markets by telegraphing what the largest national Central Bank in the world is looking to do has become more of a fright-factor to markets, as these overly-aggressive forecasts can only serve to heighten the fear felt by the very same investors discussed earlier. 
$$$$
Just put yourself in that investor’s shoes: If you were three-to-five years from retirement, and you had a nice nest egg that you’ve saved up over your entire working life – would you honestly want to be invested in stocks for the next three years as the Federal Reserve is looking to hike interest rates over 150 basis points? Rate increases, in general, mean lower stock prices as the opportunity cost of capital increases along with those rates. And given that we’re sitting on six-years’ worth of ZIRP-fueled gains, those investors are rightfully frightened given that the Federal Reserve is openly looking to normalize policy. If you put that entire nest egg in the stock market, you could potentially lose 20, 30 or 40% should another 2008-like collapse happen in markets as the flurry of factors coalesces while the Federal Reserve is looking to normalize policy. 
$$$$
The problem is unavoidable. Stock prices are still near all-time-highs despite the fact that many economic indicators are flagging signs of weakness or at the very least, lackluster growth. This is a problem that the Fed is going to have to encounter at some point, as Quantitative Tightening will be necessary to off-set six years of Quantitative Easing. 
$$$$
The risk that we have is that if the Fed does back off of this hike, investors may just be encouraged to jump back into stocks and ‘buy the dip’ as they’ve become so accustomed to doing. This is excessive risk taking (due largely to a dearth of available investment options as a result of ZIRP), and this is precisely what the Fed is looking to offset by hiking rates, even if it’s just 25 basis points. 
$$$$
But if the Fed does continue talking up a rate hike in 2015 and if they ultimately pull the trigger, risk could be off in a very big way as investors brace for impact and sell out of stocks. This is where we can see the Euro and Yen strengthen as QE-fueled carry trades unwind; and with multiple Fed members set to speak this week – there is a realistic probability of this scenario happening.  
$$$$
The S&P has traded up to a familiar level of resistance:
$$$$

$$$$
2. Despite this, one of the best trade-themes in the world continues to be ‘moreQE’ – While the Fed is looking to normalize policy for very obvious reasons, the rest of the world is facing a more difficult investing environment, and this is likely at least partly-due to the fact that the Fed is looking to tighten policy. But in Japan, Europe, China and the rest of Asia – policy makers are likely looking at even more loosening as economic data continues to highlight weakness; and with the size and scope of the programs already rolled out, it’s likely that they’re so committed to these stimulus measures that they’ll continue adding until it eventually ‘works’ or ‘breaks.’  
$$$$
This is we’re seeing in both Japan and Europe; as both of these economies recently showed signs of deflation despite the fact that the Central Banks representing these economies are in the midst of full-fledged QE programs. Most investors expect more stimulus from each of these banks at some point in the future; and as data looks increasingly gloom for both Europe and Japan, investors are increasing bets that more stimulus is coming.  
$$$$
To play ‘risk-on,’ or that normalized environment in which investors are confident of assuming risk, traders could look to sell EUR/USD, and to buy USD/JPY along with stock markets around-the-world. This is, essentially, trading on the expectation that the Fed will be able to successfully tighten policy, albeit slowly, while Japan and Europe address their economic ails individually through additional stimulus measures.  
$$$$
One way of timing that short EUR/USD trade is to watch for retail sentiment to flip, as we discussed in the article Is the EUR/USD down-trend ready for resumption.  
$$$$
On the other hand, should the ‘risk-off’ environment come back with similar force that was seen towards the end of August and the middle-of-September, look to trade the other side of each of these pairs as carry trades unwind in a ‘flight-to-quality.’ This is exactly what we saw when risk was selling off en masse on August 24th and September 17th and 18th, and this is yet another consequence of ZIRP when many assets around the world are trading with a near-binary-like ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’ nature.

Stocks Sink on Fears of a Commodity Collapse	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/29/Market-Talk-9-29-2015.html	1443528000	"
Asian stocks traded lower on continued slowdown fears; and with a heavy week of data ahead, expect price action to mirror the prints as markets are ‘on edge.’ 
$$$$
Continued weakness in commodity prices is seeping into many economies. 
$$$$
Many markets are continuing to trade in a ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’ pattern, as we’ve been looking at for the past two weeks.
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. After a brutal Monday in European and US equities, stocks in Asia opened with much of the same: Hong Kong lost -2.96%, the Nikkei was down -4.05%, the ASX 200 out of Australia was down by -3.81% and stocks in Mainland China were down a relatively modest -2.02% (Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)) and -1.51% (Shenzhen Composite (SZCOMP)). 
$$$$
The source of current panic appears to be the surprise miss for Chinese Industrial Profits on Monday morning. This number printed at an -8.8% decline, and re-kindled fears that a Chinese slowdown would become contagious and drag down an already weak US and British recovery while Europe battles with their own economic ills. The most vulnerable area of markets has been commodities; with commodity stocks and commodity currencies facing extra pressure.  
$$$$
The Glencore saga taking place right now is somewhat indicative of how a Chinese slowdown could impact foreign economies. With slower demand for raw materials and commodities out of China, prices have dropped dramatically. As these prices have dropped, margins for commodity-producers have been squeezed – making it difficult, if not impossible to meet debt service levels. And as these commodity producers face additional hardships in paying their loans, the banks holding that debt become more risk-averse with other investments in the portfolio, which can lead to a credit squeeze. This is an overly-simplified example, but you get the gist of how a slowdown in commodity prices will likely spell additional pain throughout markets.  
$$$$
This is concerning, and as our own Ilya Spivak points out, The Glencore Stock Drop Conjures Up Images of the Lehman Brothers Collapse. 
$$$$
This is likely just the beginning, as there is no end in sight to the run that we’re seeing in commodities. And while this may appear bad, an already-sensitive US economy that’s recently enjoyed the benefits of shale extraction and fracking will likely face increased turbulence as these companies report quarterly earnings and continue to operate in a ‘below-break-even’ environment.  
$$$$
The next big piece of Chinese data can be telling, as Chinese Manufacturing PMI released on Wednesday night/Thursday morning (Wednesday night, 9PM EDT) will give us additional hints as to how aggressively that slowdown is taking place in China. The expectation is for a print of 49.7, with values below 50 indicating contraction. The larger the miss/beat of this print, the more volatility towards ‘risk-on’ and ‘risk-off’ themes one should expect.

2. A Heavy Week of Data Could Define Price Action: While this may sound like an overly-obvious statement, hear me out on this: While data is always important to price action, when markets are on edge and potentially ready to blow-up, the data prints become even more important because it can be the differentiator between ‘panic mode’ and ‘relief rally.’ This is where we’re at now after the Fed’s ‘hawkish-hold’ of September 17th. With the Fed no longer supporting the market with loose monetary policy, there are fewer and fewer reasons for investors to ‘buy the dip.’  This has led to meager bounces off of support, and precipitous selling that hasn’t been offset by the usual demand for stocks that the world has become accustomed to over the past six years of ZIRP. And these relationships cycle through many financial markets with the premise of causation rather than correlation. As weakness has continued to permeate the global economy, vulnerable areas of the market like high-yield bonds (such as the type that financed commodity-extraction processes), real estate (many markets which are above 2007 highs) and biotech can get hit especially hard.  
$$$$
Of specific importance: We get European CPI numbers on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. On Tuesday we get German data and on Wednesday we get CPI for the Euro-zone as a whole along with German Unemployment numbers. In Europe, bad is good right now… as bad data will likely spell additional QE which can then be construed as positive for stocks. Good data, or beats of these prints, would likely spell the opposite impact, a lower probability of additional easing in the future, and could equate to weakness for European stocks (which can then be translated into weakness for US and Asian stocks), along with strength in the Euro as short EUR/USD carry trades continue to unwind with risk-aversion.  
$$$$
We get quite a bit of US data as well: Consumer Confidence on Tuesday morning, along with Manufacturing ISM on Thursday and NFP on Friday. Each of these could prove market-moving, and with the heavy focus on jobs and employment in the US, expect Non-Farm Payrolls to be even more important-than-normal.  
$$$$
The exception could be Chinese Manufacturing PMI, as this is released Wednesday night in the United States, and if we get a print significantly below the 49.7 expectation, we could see significant panic develop in a short-period of time, taking some of the wind out of the sails of this NFP Friday.

More Slowdown Signs: Chinese Imports, British Inflation Disappoint	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/10/13/market-talk-10-13-2015.html	1444738500	"
Good news/bad news out of China last night: China posted a record trade-surplus in Yuan terms; but this was on the back of a -20.4% contraction in imports – further highlighting slowdown within the Chinese economy. 
$$$$
The UK posted disappointing inflation with a -.1% contraction in September, showing how the global slowdown has now found its way into the British economy. 
$$$$
A loaded remainder of the week of economic announcements could bring heightened volatility across global markets.  
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Chinese trade data was released last night, and it wasn’t pretty: Imports sank by -20.4% year-over-year, far below the expectation for a -15% contraction in imports. Exports fell by -3.7%, far below the 6.3% gain that was expected. This amounts to a record trade surplus for China in Yuan terms (and nearly a record in USD terms) with a $60.34 billion trade surplus.  
$$$$
This massive miss in imports highlights the deepening of the slowdown in China. Domestic activity remains subdued as the slowdown continues to engulf the Chinese economy.  Recently rolled out measures that we mentioned yesterday could provide some help down-the-road, but Beijing will likely need to do more in the coming months to fully arrest these recessionary forces. 
$$$$
This negative print seemed to create more concern with China’s trading partners than China-itself. Chinese stocks held on to small gains to close the session with the Shanghai Composite up by .17% and the Shenzhen Composite up by 1.05%. But elsewhere in Asia, price action was more aggressive: The Nikkei went down by -1.11%, the ASX out of Australia moved lower by -.57% and the Hang Seng out of Hong Kong was down by a similar -.57%.  
$$$$
Perhaps more attractive are moves seen in the currency market, as the down-trends in many commodity currencies may be on their way back. AUD/USD and NZD/USD both moved lower on the data, and USD/CAD has put in a handsome two-day rally to pop back above the vaulted 1.3000 level on the pair. As we had discussed previously, the Japanese Yen could be a favored safe-haven vehicle of choice in ‘risk-off’ types of markets; and traders can look to buy the Yen against the Australian Dollar to make more of a concentrated play on an Asian-slowdown. The chart below highlights the current setup in AUD/JPY. 
$$$$
Chinese inflation data comes out tonight, and this could be pivotal as it speaks a little more closely to the growth number that’s being watched so closely out of China. China has been persistent about the 7% growth target despite the flurry of recessionary forces being seen in the country, and should inflation print at a disappointing number, this could be a direct forecast of weaker growth within the Chinese economy.  
$$$$

$$$$
2. British Deflation:  In another surprise print thus far on the early week, British Inflation printed negatively as CPI fell to -.1% in September. This was driven by lackluster gains in clothing prices, fuel and the price of household gas. This was the first negative inflation print that we’ve seen for the UK since April, and this diminishes hopes for that rate hike in early 2016 that markets have begun to look for out of the British economy.  
$$$$
In the most recent Bank of England meeting, Governor Mark Carney struck a cautious tone around global growth concerns, but continued to say that the view on higher rates should ‘come into sharper focus around the end of the year.’ This continuation of lackluster growth in the British and American economies, once the ‘high-flying’ economies that seemed certain to raise rates before the rest of the world, goes to show how the global growth slowdown has permeated throughout the rest-of-the-world. No economy is immune any longer.  
$$$$
The British Pound took a near-immediate drubbing on the news, as we’re seeing GBP/USD down ~150 pips on the day, with GBP/JPY down nearly ~200.  
$$$$

$$$$
3. There’s a lot of news left for the remainder of the week:  With these two pieces of bad data, markets can be thought of as taking another step closer to the ledge. Since we’ve seen stock markets come back over the past two weeks and as we’ve seen risk-assets take a step back from the ledge, we’ve also seen the Fed get more aggressive towards that 2015 rate-hike talk. This was the catalyst that seemed to throw matters in disarray over the past couple of months, and this could certainly provide more ammunition right now.  
$$$$
Should data continue to paint a negative picture, we can easily see those massive ‘risk-off’ trends of a couple of weeks ago come back into markets. This would equate to themes such as weakness in Stocks, particularly in Germany and the United States, weakness in USD/JPY and strength in EUR/USD as carry trades unwind further in a ‘risk-off’ campaign.  
$$$$
Of particular importance on the data front will be Chinese CPI, released tonight at 9:30 PM EDT, just as Chinese equity markets open for the day. Tomorrow morning, we get US Advance Retail Sales, followed by the Fed beige book at 2:00 PM EDT. Tomorrow night brings Australian employment numbers, and Thursday morning brings us inflation out of the United States followed by New Zealand CPI. We close the week with U of Michigan Consumer Confidence on Friday morning at 10:00 AM EDT.  
$$$$
The environment is ripe for volatility. As always, trade carefully: any position taken on is but one of a thousand insignificant little trades that a trader will take on in their career.

A Raft of Bad Data Sends Global Stock Prices Higher	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/10/16/market-talk-10-16-2015.html	1445000460	"
A rough week of data has propelled global stock prices higher, as hopes of ‘looser for longer’ reign supreme across global markets. 
$$$$
Chinese data has been especially painful, and Chinese GDP on Monday morning (Sunday night in the US) could set the tone for risk trends throughout the week. 
$$$$
The prevailing thought is now that the Fed is backing off of a 2015 rate hike; but we don’t yet know that for sure. Fedspeak next week could provide significant volatility.  
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. It’s been an interesting week across global markets, with the big events being the massive drop in the US Dollar (which likely isn’t yet over, as outlined by our own Christopher Vecchio this morning) combined with the disappointing data prints around-the-world. This was the first full week that Chinese markets were open after the Golden Week holiday, and we saw quite a bit of news out of the economy.  We've also seen the second largest buying spree in silver in 12 years, as pointed out by our own Jamie Saettele.
$$$$
On Monday, we heard of fresh stimulus announcements that could be positioned as a form of ‘Chinese QE.’  This is an extension of a pilot program in which banks can pledge a variety of assets like other bank loans as collateral with the Central Bank. The pilot had been running in Shandong and Guangdong, but in the announcement on Monday we found out that this program was going to be rolled out to nine more provinces, including Beijing and Shanghai.  
$$$$
But this was followed by a blowout print on Tuesday that saw Chinese imports decline by more than 1/5th, a -20.4% contraction while exports disappointed as well. This is more than evidence of slowdown in Asia, this is a direct illustration of contraction: Such a dramatic drop in imports spells problems for producers that export to the economy, and this week we’ve heard from plenty of American companies blaming an Asian-slowdown on their missed Earnings announcements. This isn’t likely to stop anytime soon as we’re in the midst of earnings season in the US.  
$$$$
On Wednesday, we got even more disappointing Chinese data as inflation came in below expectations, printing at 1.6% v/s an expectation of 1.8%. While this isn’t nearly as big of a miss as the trade data from the day before, this is very discouraging for those 7% growth targets that the Chinese economy is clinging on to. The Chinese government targets 3% inflation (versus the Fed and ECB targeting 2%) and we can now add the Chinese economy to the growing list of lackluster inflation/negative inflation/deflation theme. We’ve already seen deflation out of Japan, Europe and Germany. 
$$$$
The net result of all of this data: Chinese equity markets (and many around-the-world) have throttled higher; likely under the presumption that more easing is coming down the road, particularly in the form of interest rate cuts and cuts to bank reserve requirements for the Chinese economy.  
$$$$
We get the big print out of China on Monday morning (Sunday night at 10PM EDT in the United States): Chinese GDP. The expectation is for a 6.8% print, just below the 7% target of the Chinese government, and big misses or beats of this number can inspire significant volatility. If we do happen to see a big miss, fully expect more announcements to follow later in the week of additional stimulus measures, or perhaps even rate or reserve-requirement cuts.  
$$$$
The most attractive venue for trading this theme has been, without a doubt, in Gold. As this convergence of bad news around the world has hit global markets, expectations for rate hikes out of the United States have been getting kicked further and further into the future. And to be sure, this was likely the most dominating pressure point when global markets were selling off over the past six weeks, as we outlined in Are Global Markets Losing Confidence in the Fed. 
$$$$
Gold prices have put in some significant strength this week, and after throttling through multiple resistance levels we’ve seen a temporary pause in the up-trend as prices have resisted at the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the most recent major move. The price zone at $1,170 could be pivotal moving forward as this was the previous swing-high and a critical point of resistance. If prices can move back towards this prior point of resistance today or early next week, this could offer a top-side entry that could be really attractive in a ‘looser for longer’ type of environment.

$$$$
2. Here Comes the ECB:  It’s amazing the difference that a few months can make… 
$$$$
Earlier in the summer, much of the world was debating ‘Grexit’ scenarios and the potential dissolution of the European Union; only to be replaced by many calling the Euro a ‘safe haven’ currency a few months later as Chinese markets began facing turbulence.    But, the Euro was probably not being used as a safe-haven, and more likely we were seeing carry trades unwind as risk-aversion picked up in the global economy. 
$$$$
The logic of such a situation makes perfect sense: As Mario Draghi announced European QE last year, investors sold Euros in anticipation of an upcoming QE program. US Dollars were a very attractive candidate for selling Euros, as the Federal Reserve had already ended QE and had begun talking up this September of 2015 rate hike, and as European QE came online this only served to extend the down-trend in the pair. This offered one of those beautiful situations of divergent monetary policy where the FX trader can simply sit in the trend and add to the position on pull backs. This lasted for a while, a little over ten months to be exact, as the EUR/USD dropped by ~3500 pips. But after bottoming in March, EUR/USD began creeping higher.  
$$$$
Does this mean that the down-trend is over? No. But this does mean that what we know now is probably already factored into price. And as the Fed backs off of rate hikes, we’re going to need additional reasons to sell the Euro to see the down-trend in the pair come back; as in, if the ECB announces more QE, there is reason for EUR/USD to move lower… and as the European economy grapples with deflation despite the fact that QE is running full-throttle, the odds of this happening increase nicely.  
$$$$
With the ECB meeting on Thursday, we may hear more on this theme…  
$$$$
The technical setup in EUR/USD is not ready for trend-resumption yet. We’re still working on a 7-month plus bear-flag formation (shown below). One operative way of timing such a move is with SSI, or the Speculative Sentiment Index. Should the European Central Bank make overtures towards additional stimulus, this is when we can see sentiment flip as that down-trend goes back into resumption. We outlined this strategy in the article, Is the Euro Downtrend Ready for Resumption; but until this criteria is met, we’re trading in a bear-flag.

3. The Primary Driver Across Global Markets Continues to Be Central Bank Support:  If the moves over the past two months proves anything, it’s that Central Bank support continues to be the primary driver behind global risk trends.  
$$$$
The Fed’s hawkish-hold in September spooked markets: The prospect of tighter monetary policy in the United States while much of the rest of the economic world faced difficulty was enough to add fire risk-off trends. 
$$$$
But the further we moved away from the September Fed meeting, and more bad data that we saw out of the global economy, the less likely investors felt that we’d actually see anything anytime soon. At this point, a 2015 rate-hike is pretty much priced-out of most markets with March 2016 appearing as the next most likely meeting for a hike. But we don’t know this yet, and we haven’t heard this directly from the Fed. If the Fed does, in fact, back off – those trends of USD weakness are likely to shine, especially in avenues such as Gold. But should the Fed continue talking up this aggressive stance towards rate hikes, we could quickly and easily see ‘risk-off’ trends reverse.  
$$$$
We hear from Lael Brainard of the Fed on Monday, followed by Jeffrey Lacker later in the day. Tuesday sees Mr. William Dudley followed by the head of the Fed herself, Ms. Janet Yellen at 11 AM. And then Jerome Powell speaks on Wednesday at 1:30 PM to close out the Fed speak for the week, and Thursday brings on ECB and Friday sees Canadian CPI.  
$$$$
Next week will likely be active. For now, the S&P is continuing to trade higher, and the 2021 resistance level that we’ve been pointing out over the past few weeks (that also functioned as the September FOMC swing-high) is now coming in as intra-day support.

Don't Call it a Comeback: Small-Cap Chinese Stocks Throttle Higher	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/10/20/market-talk-10-20-2015.html	1445344800	"
Chinese stocks continue to trade higher, especially smaller-capitalization companies as margin debt is driving stock prices higher, reminiscent of the Chinese equity rally earlier in the year. 
$$$$
The Chinese GDP print yesterday may have bought Mario Draghi some time, as the ECB meets on Thursday while the market waits to hear of an increased QE-outlay for the economy. 
$$$$
The Bank of Japan meets later in the month where, again, investors are hoping for more QE.  
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Chinese data has been rough of late. Just yesterday, we saw the country miss their 7% growth target for the first time since the Financial Collapse, and last week we saw an abysmal trade report that had a contraction of over 20% for imports. And for a global economy that’s come to depend on China for a large portion of its growth – that’s troubling. But if you’re looking at Chinese stocks, you wouldn’t notice that anything was wrong.  
$$$$
Since bottoming on September 15th, the Shenzhen Composite (SZCOMP), which largely consists of small technology stocks, is up over 34%. The ChiNext Composite Index traded more than 5 billion shares on Friday of last week, a new record that eclipses any volume amounts that were seen during the rally earlier in the year that catapulted stocks up over 100% year-over-year, and led to the panic moves and the fear of a ‘bubble popping’ in June, July and August. This index had plunged as much as 54% from its June highs, and in early September – this index was pretty much dead as volumes had fallen off by more than 99%. What was previously one of the most active futures markets in the world became completely quiet as regulators had tightened position limits and started a probe into ‘malicious short sellers.’ 
$$$$
At the heart of the move is increased margin trading in small, low-priced stocks. Margin debt has increased for seven consecutive days, and this is very similar to the type of increases in margin trading that led to the summer fall, as retail traders increased margin to chase high-flying stocks. And the fact that the rebound in Shanghai, where larger and more stable companies are listed, has been significantly lighter than what we’ve seen in more volatile types of names points to the fact that investors are bidding up smaller, more speculative companies instead of more-established blue chip names. 
$$$$
This would allude to the fact that this rebound being seen in China, and hence, Asia – is retail driven and may be short-lived. Investors are lining up with anticipation that more government intervention may be coming down the road. From China – this is a fairly sound bet, as it’s largely expected that we’ll see at least another interest rate cut, and likely a cut to bank reserve requirements before the end of the year. 
$$$$
But the bigger question is the Fed, and whether they’ll back off of a 2015 rate hike or not. For now, risk is on under the anticipation of ‘looser for longer.’ But this story isn’t over yet.

2. Weak Chinese GDP may have bought Mario Draghi some time: The primary driver across markets right now is hope. And not the good kind of hope either, the kind that is hopeful for improved economic performance. This hope is actually looking for worse data, in order to setup more QE down-the-road. Europe is the ultimate example of this right now, as a recently triggered QE program has shown some initial signs of promise, but for all intents and purposes, it hasn’t yet worked. Europe is still seeing lackluster inflation, and just last month the stalwart of the European economy, Germany, fell into deflation. This is troubling considering the potential storm brewing in the East, and this has led many to believe that the European Central Bank will increase their QE-efforts in the not-too-distant future.  
$$$$
But yesterday’s GDP print out of China wasn’t really all that bad; While it did miss the 7% growth target that the country sets forth, the 6.9% print did beat the expectation of a 6.8% number. And given the fact that many economies in Asia are expected to roll out intervention or stimulus programs in the coming months, this could’ve bought the ECB some time for that next QE-decision.  
$$$$
From a technical vantage point – the short Euro trade isn’t ready yet. Since bottoming in March, we’ve been working on a bear-flag formation, which is a price action setup that sees a rising channel after an extended move lower. This is the hallmark of a ‘retracement’ that will often come into a market after a notable move. 
$$$$
Notice on the weekly chart below, last week gave us an inflection off of the mid-line of the channel. This could be a first step to a short position, but the down-trend is not back in the EUR/USD until this bear-flag is broken, and as of right now, the bottom of this flag projects to approximately 1.1067 for next week.  
$$$$
Another way of timing the trade is with SSI, as we had outlined in the article, Is the EUR/USD downtrend ready for resumption? 
$$$$

$$$$
3. Next QE Expectation Is Looking at Japan: In a similar vein, Japan has been on the QE-outlay for nearly three years now, and inflation still has yet to satisfy expectations. With China recently revaluing the Yuan, this could be seen as more pressure on Tokyo as China is Japan’s primary trade partner. A weaker Yuan makes for a more difficult trading environment for Japan, and this is yet another reason for the country to look at an increased QE-outlay. The only problem is that the country has run out of bonds to monetize, so any future QE-efforts will likely need to be in a new, and creative way.  
$$$$
Up-to-this-point, the Bank of Japan has been reticent to announce any speculation of increased bond purchases, and this is what has helped to create near-term resistance on the Yen. On the chart below, notice the 120 level that’s currently holding as resistance in the pair. Should the BOJ talk up an increased intervention policy at their next meeting on October 30th, expect the Yen to weaken massively. This would be similar to their moves last year when they surprised markets with an announcement of increased QE on Halloween.  
$$$$
But if the BOJ does not talk up increased QE, or if they elect to hold bond purchases steady – expect USD/JPY to drop as US rate hikes get kicked further and further into the future.

ECB to Re-Examine QE, but Will Traders Wait to Sell EUR/USD?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/10/22/market-talk-10.22.2015.html	1445519640	"
The European Central Bank met today, and as expected kept rates steady. But the head of the ECB, Mr. Mario Draghi, announced that the bank will re-examine QE for the upcoming December meeting. 
$$$$
This announcement led to near-immediate weakness in the Euro, but the more relevant question is whether the long-term bear-trend is back in the single currency; we discuss multiple ways of trading that theme below. 
$$$$
The UK had another positive print this morning as retail sales posted a brisk up-side surprise; this could open the door for the short EUR/GBP trade to play the monetary policy dichotomy between the two economies. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$1. ECB announces that they’ll re-examine QE in December: European-area growth has been lackluster since the launch of QE, and to end last month we saw European inflation turn negative as the economy joined Japan in the ‘deflation’ category. But stocks have rocketed higher since this print, as the expectation was that the European Central Bank would increase their QE program to offset this weakness in the effort of nudging inflation higher so that, eventually, rates could move out of negative territory. Mario Draghi said ‘there are risks which could further slowdown the gradual increase in inflation rates towards levels closer to 2%.’ He also said ‘the asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration,’ and he kicked off the meeting with the most important statement of them all: ‘The degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-examined at our December monetary meeting.’  
$$$$
This led to near-immediate weakness in the Euro as EUR/USD spiked down by more than 60 pips shortly after the opening statement. European yields made a quick move lower, as the 2-year German Bund moved down to an all-time low of -.29%. That’s right; investors are paying the German government -.29% annually to hold their money.  
$$$$
But the bigger question is the trend in the Euro and whether that EUR/USD down-trend is back, as this was by far one of the more attractive trends over the last couple of years as traders played the monetary policy dichotomy between Europe and the United States. This led to a ~3,500 pip run that lasted from May of 2014 (when Drahi had last announced that they would make a future announcement regarding QE) to March of 2015. 
$$$$
With this recognition of the need for additional stimulus, traders may not wait around for the Euro down-trend before selling. We outlined a couple of different ways to look at playing trend resumption in the Euro in the article, Is the Euro Down-Trend Ready for Resumption; and as we discussed, there is a 7+ month bear-flag in the pair after the lows were set in March. Traders can wait for this flag to break before looking for trend-resumption, but for those looking to be more aggressive, there is a shorter-term trend-line within the flag that could allow for a quicker short-side entry (shown on the below chart in purple). And for traders that wanted to confirm the legitimacy of the move, they can apply SSI to look for retail positioning to flip before looking to build a longer-term position against the Euro.

$$$$
2. Sterling moves higher on strong retail sales: The UK has been one of the few economies in the world other than the US that has a tangible prospect of hiking rates in the next 12 months. Throughout much of the year, BoE Governor Mark Carney has continued to say that the prospect of rate hikes should become more clear around the end of the year; and this has led to somewhat of a ‘data-dependency’ for expectations of that first rate hike for the UK since 2009. So, naturally inflation for the UK has become an interesting and especially marketing moving data-point, as this is thought to be that primary pre-cursor to a rate hike. And just last week, we saw the UK go into deflation as September CPI printed at -.1% and this moved the British Pound lower against most currencies; but just a day later, a surprise improvement in employment data, led by wage growth (which is a pre-cursor to inflation) that, when combined with the deflationary print from the day before means that we saw the highest real UK wage growth since the Financial Crisis.  
$$$$
So, this was like one step backwards and two-forward for hopes of an earlier-than-expected rate hike out of the UK. This morning, we saw more confirmation of positive UK-growth when retail sales came in at 1.9% versus an expectation of .4%. This prodded the Sterling higher by over .5% as those rate hike bets picked up; and moving forward – this highlights the sterling as one of the few currencies that traders might be able to look for a future rate hike.  
$$$$
Perhaps more to the point, when combined with a European economy that’s likely looking at further loosening of monetary policy, this can open up the short EUR/GBP trade to take advantage of that monetary policy dichotomy in the coming months, and if the ECB does happen to extend their QE program as many expect, traders can sit in the trend as that dichotomy grows.

Euro Stagnant After Unchanged Rates; Market Waits for Draghi	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/10/22/Euro-Stagnant-After-Unchanged-Rates-Market-Waits-for-Draghi.html	1445515740	"

The market waits for ECB’s Press Conference for further action

Talking Points:
$$$$
The Euro was little changed versus the US Dollar after today’s ECB rate decision saw interest rates unchanged at 0.05 percent, as expected. The ECB also kept the Deposit rate unchanged at negative -0.20 percent, and the Marginal Lending Facility at 0.30 percent, as expected. 
$$$$
The market has been selling the Euro at the London open today, betting on Euro weakness ahead of the rate decision, even though economists expected no change in rates. DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak suggested that the price action probably reflected positioning ahead of dovish rhetoric from ECB president Mario Draghi, who might set the stage for further QE in December in the ECB’s press conference later today.

Talking Points:
$$$$
The Euro was little changed versus the US Dollar after today's Targeted LTRO showed decreasing demand by Euro-Zone banks for low interest rate loans. Euro-Zone’s banks bid 15.548B Euros with June figure higher at 73.8B. LTRO’s provide long term refinancing by the ECB to the financial sector by offering liquidity to banks. These low-cost loans are granted to banks on the condition that they are lent to the real economy, which usually leads to lower long-term interest rates. Lower demand for these types of loans suggests funding conditions are going back to normal as banks revert to regular market financing.

After today’s above expected IFO numbers, and US Core Durable Goods Orders later today expected to show a drop in August- the market was little encouraged to initiate new trading positions on the EUR/USD, waiting for the new data later today to take affect.

Weakness continues to show in global stocks in the wake of last week’s FOMC announcement. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Want to time the EUR/USD short position? Watch SSI: One of the more interesting developments since last week’s FOMC announcement has been renewed weakness in the Euro as the Fed’s hawkish stance contrasts nicely with the accommodative, looser monetary policy expectations out of Europe. At the most recent ECB meeting, Mr. Mario Draghi had mentioned that the bank could expand the bond-buying program if necessary. And with continued weakness showing in the European economy and inflation nearly non-existent, it’s beginning to look pretty likely that something like that might be necessary by the ECB’s standards.  
$$$$
Since topping out at 1.1460 the morning after FOMC, EURUSD has put in three consecutive days of declines in a move that’s seen the pair drop by over 300 pips. But perhaps more interesting is what we’ve seen in positioning in the pair – which is - as the EUR/USD has continued dropping, retail traders have been closing shorts and getting long.  As SSI is a contrarian indicator, when this reading flips long it can be a really attractive short signal. When this happened in 2014, EUR/USD staged a 3,000 pip movement lower. In the below chart, we’re looking at historical SSI (in red and green bars) extrapolated behind price (black line). Notice how inversely this has moved in the recent past – as growing short positions (in red) are often met with inclines in EUR/USD and growing long exposure (in green) is met with price declines.

$$$$
This is noteworthy because as these declines have mounted in the EUR/USD, we’ve seen that retail trader exposure narrow to the point where it’s almost flipped long. As of right now, approximately 47% of retail traders are long in the pair, and if you want to follow this in real-time on your charts, any live FXCM account can get access to this indicator to do so free-of-charge. In the below chart, we’re looking at the current setup in EUR/USD. Notice how the short-term trend-line (that had previously made up the under-side of the short-term bear-flag) has been broken while the ‘bigger picture,’ longer-term bear-flag remains in play on the pair.

When SSI flips long, this can be a really attractive indication to look at the short-side EUR/USD play. While no indicator is predictive, trading on the other side of retail positioning can be an excellent way to incorporate a probabilistic-type of approach into your repertoire.  
$$$$
2. Chinese PMI prints at lowest level in six years: The Caxin Purchasing Managers’ Index printed at 47 versus an expectation of 47.5, with reads below 50 indicating contraction.  This is the weakest PMI print in over six years, and for an industrial-based economy this is a vitally important data point as it’s indicative of manufacturing activities taking place within the economy. This is the sixth consecutive month in which Chinese PMI has printed below 50, and this highlights concerns that the 7% growth target for the economy will be difficult, if not impossible to attain. Chinese stocks sold off on the back of this missed PMI print, with the Shanghai Composite (shcomp) shedding -2.19% while the Shenzhen Composite (szcomp) dropped by -.83%. 
$$$$
Chinese President Xi Jinping kicked off his US-tour yesterday in Seattle, and he repeated a prior statement that China will be able to maintain medium to high growth. He also mentioned that China is committed to market-based reforms and that the country wanted to ‘modify, not overturn, the economic world order.’ 
$$$$
This could possibly be seen as statements that the Chinese government will roll out additional stimulus measures should the contraction in the economy continue to swell. The slowdown is very real, and we’re starting to see this weakness throughout the Asian economy in data points like visitors to Macau from South Korea dropping by -25% in a year. It’s perilously difficult to try to stop these types of trends, because the risk is that measures to shore up the economy may actually make the situation worse.  
$$$$
We will likely see additional stimulus measures out of China, and we’ll probably see more reserve-requirement cuts (meaning that margin will be decreased so that banks can take on even more leverage as the economy (and investments) turns against them).  
$$$$
Stocks in Hong Kong put in a similar movement in the overnight session, with the Hang Seng dropping by -2.3% while Shanghai shed -2.2%. In the below chart, we’re looking at the same 22,000 level on the Hang Seng that we had mentioned previously, and notice the failed breakout attempt last week. This, along with the Yen could be one of the more attractive ways for westerners to trade the ‘growth slowdown theme.’ 
$$$$

$$$$
3. Stocks have held on, for now: After spending most of yesterday’s US session holding on to losses, the S&P 500 continued lower into the Asian session, bottoming out shortly after the Chinese open, establishing a near-term low at 1,921. But since then, stocks have clawed their way back up to prior Fibonacci and trend-line support at 1,950. This is an example in which old support may be coming in as new resistance in a down-trend.  
$$$$
Given the weakness seen yesterday before we ever got to the PMI print out of China would indicate that the issue here isn’t China, and is probably more related to the Federal Reserve and the confusion that’s come about because of the ‘hawkish-hold’ that the bank gave markets at the September meeting. 
$$$$
On the below chart of the SPX500, we’re looking at recently-broken trend-line support to go along with a Fibonacci retracement that’s been seeing significant price action of late. This Fibonacci retracement can be drawn by taking the high at 2,137 and drawing down to the ‘panic lows’ of 8/24 (shown on the below chart, in blue).

"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. It was another rough patch of Chinese data released over the weekend, further indicating economic slowdown in the economy that’s created worry around-the-globe. This time it was a miss on industrial output, which for China is an extremely important number given their large-scale exporting activity: Industrial output printed at 6.1% for August from a year prior, below the expectation of 6.5% and Fixed Asset Investment printed at 10.9% v/s an expectation of 11.2%.
$$$$
These prints are after five interest rate cuts and a flurry of government stimulus, highlighting concerns that Beijing may not be able to offset the selling that is taking place across their equity markets. The Shanghai Composite (shcomp) closed lower by -2.67% after being down by as much as -4.7% during the session, while the Shenzhen Composite (szcomp) closed down by -6.65% after a brutal session that saw persistent selling throughout with aggressive price action.  
$$$$
Correspondingly, the Nikkei moved lower by -1.63%, and as we looked at on Friday – this could be a favored way of playing the ‘panic’ theme in the coming weeks. Weakness in China is likely to have a big impact on Japan should this theme continue developing, and this could be seen in the currency market as well as across stocks. Short Nikkei and Long Yen (short USD/JPY) could be favored ways of playing risk aversion in the current environment. Below is the daily chart of the Nikkei, and notice the five consecutive daily wicks showing at the 18,215 resistance: This is a clear example of resistance in a market, and the recent post lower on this daily chart could be encouraging for the initiation of short positions. Stops could be placed at 18408, 18500 or 18752 based on how aggressively the trader wanted to treat the position.

2. What’s up with the Euro? One of the topics noticeably absent from the headlines of recent have been Europe and perhaps of more importance for currency traders, EURUSD. As panic began to sweep the globe, in mid-August, EURUSD began to spike higher and many ‘pundits’ began to claim that the Euro had become a ‘safe-haven’ currency, and investors were loading into Euro-based investments to shield the storm.  
$$$$
For a currency that had traded lower by ~20% in a year representing an economy that had, only three months earlier, been mired in breakup-scenarios as we inched closer to a ‘grexit,’ this was a ridiculous assertion. David Rodriguez dispelled this notion of ‘euro as a safe haven’ in his article, ‘No, The Euro has not Suddenly Become a Safe-Haven Currency.’ 
$$$$
More likely, the strength in EURUSD was from traders that were holding short positions closing their trades; often called ‘unwind.’ As the European Central Bank embarked on their first round of QE, and after Mario Draghi proclaimed that he and the bank would do ‘whatever it takes’ to salvage the Euro, investors looked to take advantage of yet another Central Bank intervention program by financing trades in Euros. And as the United States inched closer to a rate hike, or at the very least tightening of policy, a clear delineation had shown in the monetary policy of the two economies represented in EURUSD making for a an attractive carry trade. So as investors became more confident that the global economy would be ‘ok’ and that Europe would make it through their current debt stand-offs, short EURUSD became increasingly attractive. This is why the pair had moved down by as much as ~3,500 pips earlier in the year.  
$$$$
But as questions around that FOMC rate hike arose earlier in the year, and as issues such as falling oil prices and a Chinese slowdown became more prominent, the risk-reward of that short EURUSD carry trade no longer looked so attractive. This is what sidelined new sellers, and brought demand into the pair as those that had sold during the 3,500 pip down-trend looked to tighten up their risk and close their positions with the numerous question marks spinning around global markets. This is often referred to as a ‘short squeeze,’ and in the chart below – we highlight two different ‘bear flag’ formations that are indicative of such a scenario.  
$$$$
For now traders should be cautious with near-term short EURUSD positions. That short EURUSD trade could again become attractive, but not until we see a sense of calm come into global markets, at least enough to intrigue investors to jump back into the carry trade provided that the alarm bells stop sounding.

3. Stocks are congested and ready to break: Since the pandemonium of 8/24 has moved further into the rear-view mirror, investors have remained cautious ahead of Thursday’s FOMC announcement. On the S&P 500 specifically, the sell-off on 8/24 moved prices lower to test a six-year trend-line that’s been in effect on the index (shown on the left side of chart below). This set a low at 1,833.50, and since then the S&P has been working on lower-highs, and higher-lows; a hallmark of congestion as we near a ‘big event’ in a market. That big event is on Thursday, and if we haven’t broken through this near-term congestion (shown on the below chart, on the right), then Thursday will likely provide the catalyst to do so.

All Eyes On FOMC for the Most Significant Rate Decision In Years	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/11/market-talk-9-11-2015.html	1441976160	"
Global stocks begin to stabilize ahead of FOMC, as volatility levels are on the rise to reflect the tumult of the past 3 weeks. 
$$$$
Risk trends have aligned with the ‘risk on’ or ‘risk off’ themes based around global economic weakness. 
$$$$
More attractive markets may currently be seen in long USD against emerging market currencies from Mexico or South Africa. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Global stocks steady ahead of the Fed: After three volatile weeks of price actionacross global markets, a sense of stability has begun to show over the past 24 hours as the world nears the much-awaited September FOMC meeting. While there are numerous headline-worthy events that can be assigned a primary role for the recent tumult across global markets, the uncertainty in the communication of the Central Bank representing the world’s largest national economy is likely a large driver of confusion and fear. 
$$$$
This has helped to bring considerable volatility across markets: Just yesterday we saw 10-day volatility levels on Japanese stocks surpass those of the Chinese equity market that’s been taking a drubbing since mid-June. And now, we’re beginning to see volatility levels on the S&P 500 surpass those of their small-cap counterparts in the Russell 2,000 index.  
$$$$
We’ve seen VIX surpass the value of the Russell-VIX six times since August 24th when the outsized sell-off in China began to hit the United States with aggression. Before August 24th – this had only happened twice in the prior 11 years; which of course includes the financial collapse. 
$$$$
This is a huge deal: Small-cap stocks, by nature, should be more volatile than their larger and significantly-more-established brethren. The fact that we are seeing so much brutal uncertainty in large-cap names just goes to show the unexpected consequences of ZIRP and the fact investors bought up shares in large-cap names due to a dearth of available options. With rates near zero, investors that would normally buy a corporate or agency bond were left without much yield. And with a surging stock market over the past 6 years that’s seen stocks trade at all-time-highs for over two-and-a-half years, buying ‘safer’ stocks in large-cap names could be seen as a very relevant way for an investor to build their portfolio in a low-yielding environment. 
$$$$
This is the ‘excessive risk taking’ that the Fed has talked about in the past. One of the reasons they want to raise rates is to offset this excessive risk taking. But if excessive risk taking has already taken place, and the Fed looks to embark on this hike – then the unwind of this theme means that we’ll likely see more volatility, and more pain for stock prices in the months ahead.  
$$$$
For now – the S&P 500 continues to congest after a rollercoaster couple of weeks. Current resistance can be seen in the 1950, 1985 and 2,000 areas.

2. So, it makes sense not to hike, right? Unfortunately matters aren’t so simple. We’ve been down a similar road before, and the results weren’t very positive. The Fed has talked up policy tightening over the previous three years, only to back off once volatility in markets showed the fragility of the ‘recovery.’ The Taper Tantrum of 2013 highlights this theme, but markets were reassured when the Fed made certain to point out that the end of QE did not mean rate hikes were imminent.  
$$$$
For three years, some Fed officials have been circling 2015 as the target year for ‘liftoff.’ Consistency is a fairly important trait in a Central Bank, and after the previous back-tracking that we’ve seen from the bank towards rate hikes, failing to hike again after numerous reassurances throughout the year would only serve to erode that confidence even more. And if we do happen to spiral into a global recession, that additional loss of confidence only makes the Central Bank more ineffective in trying to combat deflationary forces. The Fed has said that they’re ‘data dependent,’ and that the first rate hike doesn’t mean that second is coming anytime soon; so they’ve already tried to soften the blow of the impact from that first hike.  
$$$$
The United States has begun to see inflationary forces. The earmarks of ‘data dependency’ that the Fed has given for ‘liftoff’ have already been met, long ago. If they don’t hike, they risk losing confidence; and if, by chance, markets trade higher they run the risk of stoking even more excessive risk taking. This is how bubbles get built, if they aren’t built already. If they do raise the Fed runs the risk of putting the global economy in a tailspin, as nearly every emerging market in the world is facing pressure and both Europe and Asia teeter on the brink of economic disaster.  
$$$$
The worst-case-scenario here is that if the Fed does raise, and if the global economy does lurch lower – they may have to backtrack with even more ‘especially accommodative policy.’ This happened in Europe in July of 2011 when Jean-Claude Trichet hiked rates, only to reverse the decision later in the year as the European Debt Collapse began shortly after this rate hike.  
$$$$
Add to this the varying commentary that we’ve received from various Fed members, including the hawkish tone that Ms. Yellen took during her congressional testimony earlier in the summer, and confusion reigns supreme around this FOMC decision.  
$$$$
This is shaping up to be one of the most interesting Fed meetings in years. Currently, expectations are 28% for a hike September, 39.5% for October and 58.9% for December.  
$$$$
3. Most attractive markets to be positioning around right now: Much is up-in-the-air with this FOMC decision on the docket for next week, and many markets have begun to correlate along with risk trends. The ‘risk on’ and ‘risk off’ type of environment from 2012-2013 is back in markets where risky assets are pricing roughly in-line with each other.  
$$$$
For playing ‘panic’ or ‘risk off’: Long Yen against almost any currency, long EURUSD (unwind), short stocks, particularly the Nikkei (JPN225), S&P 500 (SPX500), Hong Kong (HKG33)
$$$$
For playing ‘everything will be ok’ or ‘risk on’: Short EURUSD, Short AUDUSD, Long USDCAD, Short Gold and Long Stocks (the larger the move down over the past few weeks, the more attractive the market for playing this theme).  
$$$$
But for those that want to try to avoid the risk on/off theme, an attractive area could be seen in emerging markets; because no matter what happens next week, emerging markets are likely in for some additional pain as the impact of low oil prices begin to show in the economic data. The downgrade of Brazilian debt to junk status yesterday highlights how drooping commodity prices can show up in future data prints; which can, then, bring on further economic weakness.  
$$$$
Of particular interest are short Mexican Peso and short South African Rand against the US Dollar. Both pairs put in exuberant runs higher as panic was setting in the environment, but this merely hastened their previous up-trends. With a sense of stability coming in markets over the past week, this has helped these setups move down to more reasonable prices to the point of offering attractive risk-reward ratios. Below is the current setup on USDMXN.

Summary: 
$$$$
1. Yuan gains for first time since Tuesday and Chinese shares held gains throughout the session to end the week with their best weekly performance in over two months (since the beginning of the major sell-off). But this isn’t a one-sided positive story: Chinese stock futures are showing negative divergence with actual share prices. Futures contracts on the CSI 300 (the 300 largest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen), are trading at a ~1.5% discount to the Aug 21 contract and 3% discount to the contract expiring in later September. And given the numerous actions taken by the Chinese government to clamp down on ‘malicious short sellers,’ many believe that this divergence would be even wider in a legitimately-free market. The CSI 300 contract had become the most widely-traded stock index in the world, surpassing even the S&P 500 earlier in the year. But average daily volumes on the CSI 300 have moved down by more than 40% since the June 29 high of 3.2 million contracts traded, as many retail traders have been burned by a massive drawdown while taking on exorbitant levels of leverage.
$$$$
Now that much of this has been digested, the net effect is that the Chinese government has made two very large proclamations to the market: 1) Regulators are very worried about the economic slowdown in China, and not just the stock market collapse: This is a bigger deal than some had expected in latter June, as the hope then was that the stock market meltdown would largely stay contained. 2) The PBOC is willing to break out whatever tools they need to in effort of combating the slow-down. Short-term, this could be positive for the economy as it may stave off recessionary forces. But Long-Term, this brings on even more risks and even more questions.

2. European recovery falls short: European GDP estimates came in largely underwhelming this morning, showing the German economy growing .4% last quarter v/s an expectation of .5%, France’s quarterly growth coming in at zero v/s an expectation of .2% and Italian growth coming in at .2% v/s an expectation of .3%. The big surprise of the quarter was in Spain, where the rise of Podemos had some economists worried that Greek political and economic contagion was beginning to spread throughout Europe. The Spanish economy led growth in major euro-area economies in Q2 with GDP rising 1%.  
$$$$
EURUSD is trading slightly higher on the day behind these data misses, further highlighting the ‘unwind’ theme that we had spoken about earlier in the week. With rates in Europe so incredibly low, the Euro has become a favorite as a funding currency to fuel carry trades.  
$$$$
With the US Dollar sitting on the zone of support that we’ve been talking about (discussed further below), this could be an opportunistic time to look for EURUSD shorts. EURUSD put in a Doji formation yesterday, highlighting indecision after the pop that the pair saw on Wednesday. Watch resistance from the Wednesday high at 1.1212, and if we can see the pair close below 1.1084 then we’ll have an evening star formation to work with, which can be a great way of trying to trade a top, as it allows for concentrated risk with the potential for an outsized reversal move. 
$$$$

$$$$
3. USD and S&P both catch support: One of the more climactic themes this week was somewhat under-the-surface of some of the bigger headline issues, and that’s rate expectations for September. As China triggered this really massive action, a ‘wall of worry’ had grown in the global economy that made that September rate hike look like an outlandish prospect.  As investors began positioning out of bets for that September hike, the US Dollar lost value while US stocks sold off.  
$$$$
But this really highlights the beauty of technical analysis. While nothing in this world will perfectly predict prices, Technical analysis can help trader discern probabilities. The chart below shows a beautiful support bounce on Wednesday in the SPX500. Continue watching the 2,040-2,050 zone of support. The S&P is really just a fairly standard range right now. 
$$$$
This will often happen when there is a lack of direction on the fundamental front, and with all of these various risk factors in the world congestion in US stocks makes some sense. So, trade this like a range – and if you want to take a trend-traders approach, trade the range with a one-sided bias (only buy at support and close at resistance). If we break below 2,040, look to get out quick as a bigger correction might be in store: 
$$$$
 Created with Marketscope/Trading Station II; prepared by James Stanley
$$$$
Another range of relevance right now is the US Dollar, which broke below this recent support zone as that September hike was getting priced out of the market on Wednesday, but came back as normalcy was restored. The past 2 days have shown buying support from 11,950-11,965, and today has confirmed this theme. This could be a good chance to look to get long USD, placing a stop below the 11,947 low and looking for resistance at the 12,050 area. While nobody in the world knows if the dollar is going to pop – this type of risk-reward of 1-to-4 or 1-to-5 mean you really only need to be right ~27% of the time to build a profitable model.  
$$$$
Pairs that could be attractive for USD-strength are those commodity crosses like USDCAD, AUDUSD, and NZDUSD – as well as EURUSD.

Eurozone Approves 3-Year  €86 Billion Bailout for Greece	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/08/15/Eurozone-Approves-3-Year--86-Billion-Bailout-for-Greece.html	1439597880	"
Greece agrees with Eurozone finance ministers on an &euro;86 Billion bailout
$$$$
Top European officials highlight sustainable tranches in agreement to spur economic production
$$$$
EURUSD offers muted reaction to favorable news in week’s twilight hours
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
Eurozone finance ministers approved Greece’s third rescue program late Friday. The European Commission announced in a statement that it was ready to disburse “new loans of up to €86 Billion over the next three years” to the troubled member. Underlying the agreement to the third package in five years was an extensive list of reforms and the open question as to whether the IMF would remain party to the deal. 
$$$$
The third bailout package will be dispersed in three installments. The first payment will measure €26 Billion. This will help cover an August 20th repayment owed to the European Central Bank to the tune of €3.2 Billion. A hefty €10 Billion in funds was being earmarked for a bank recapitalization fund with another €15 Billion available should it be needed. The funds will be dealt through the ESM and will be made available after stress tests.
$$$$
Among other aspects of the deal, Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem announced protection to Greek small and medium-size enterprises saying the “bail-in of depositors will be explicitly excluded.” Instead, senior bank bondholders would be on the hook should funds be tapped. Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said in a statement that with these efforts “the process of reversing the negative effects of capital controls will start very quickly.”
$$$$
The European Commission’s Vladis Dombrovskis conceded the Greek economy would shrink over 2% this year but the agreement was needed to lift uncertainty. Managing Director of the European Stability Mechanism Klaus Regling added, “the Greek program will reshape economy if implemented”. 
$$$$
Dijsselbloem stated debt sustainability would be a major point of concern so the International Monetary Fund would be able to come on board by September. IMF Chief Christine Lagarde said in a statement, the Greek-Eurozone deal was a very important step yet reiterated it was critical for Europe to make a concrete debt relief in the pledge. She noted, “Greece cannot restore debt sustainability solely through actions on its own.” Marking a point of tension going forward Dijsselbloem characterized IMF involvement as “indispensable”. 
$$$$
EURUSD showed little change on the back of the Greek bailout news (See Jamie Saettele’s EURUSD Technical Analysis). The pair closed Friday down 0.4 percent to 1.1109. That trimmed the pair’s weekly advance to 1.3 percent. Greek 10-year bond yields dropped to their lowest level since early March while 5-year credit default swap premiums have neared similar lows.

Chinese Shares Reverse, US Data in Focus	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/08/19/Market-Talk-8-19-2015.html	1439985300	"
Chinese shares posted down by as much as 5% early in the session, leading to equity weakness around-the-world. A late-day rally brought Chinese shares back into positive territory, but other bourses did not follow. 
$$$$
US CPI is issued at 8:30 AM, and this could give us insight into that September rate hike that the Fed has been talking about. 
$$$$
At 2 PM, the minutes from the most recent Fed meeting are issued, and this could offer additional clarity around that September meeting. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. US Data takes center-stage: Two separate data points out of the United States will likely set the tone across markets today. At 8:30 AM ET, US CPI is issued with the expectation of a .2% gain with Core CPI (excluding food and energy) coming in at a 1.8% increase; and at 2PM the Minutes from the most recent Fed meeting are issued.  
$$$$
Both data releases speak to the same theme of that first US rate hike, which many economists are expecting as a foregone conclusion for the September 16-17 meeting. This despite the multiple pressure points being felt in the global economy at the current moment. While China is the obvious point of emphasis, geopolitical and economic tensions in Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and many Emerging Markets economies could be further exacerbated by Fed tightening. This is one of the reasons that USDZAR and USDMXN are such attractive candidates to play the US rate hike theme.  
$$$$
While the employment picture in the United States has brightened, inflation has remained subdued; so this CPI print at 8:30 could set off volatility if it comes in above expectations. A beat on CPI would likely spark USD strength, and near-term targets on the Dollar would be towards the 12,050 zone of resistance that’s shown in the Greenback over the past month (chart below). EURUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD and USDCAD are all attractive candidates to play this theme, as higher expectations for a September rate hike would likely show the most strength against those vulnerable commodity currencies (and the Euro as a funding currency).

2. Chinese stocks exhibit manic price action: The Chinese equity session opened with a bang – and not the good kind, as stocks sold off by as much as -5% early in the session nearing the low that was set on July 8th before the artillery of stimulus was rolled out to stabilize stock prices. The selling spread to Hong Kong, Japan and numerous smaller stock markets throughout Asia, and then into Europe.  
$$$$
After the mid-day break in Chinese trading, multiple large-cap Chinese companies issued statements disclosing their biggest shareholders, many of which include state-owned firms. This showed a clear sign that the Chinese government was intervening in the equity market by buying single shares. Many of these companies went ‘limit up’ by moving their maximum +10% in a single day of trading, and this pulled the indices back into positive territory.  
$$$$
The Shanghai Composite closed with a 1.2% gain while Shenzhen put in a 2.19% increase; much of which was in the last hour of trading. This theme isn’t over yet: Shares in Japan and Hong Kong did not enjoy this late-day rally.  
$$$$
3. Fed Minutes to offer clarity on September? In the minutes from the April Fed meeting, the bank was clear in stating that they weren’t going to offer an explicit indication of an impending rate hike. This led to a very short statement in July that’s led investors to analyzing each individual data print for the viability of a rate increase.  
$$$$
At issue is inflation – and in the July statement, the Fed continued to say that they would wait to hike rates until they were ‘reasonably confident’ that inflation would return to the 2% Fed target. There was also a subtle tweak in their comments towards employment, as previous releases said that the Fed wanted to see ‘further improvement’ in the labor market while the July statement said ‘some further improvement.’ This change of one, single word in the July statement left analysts scratching their heads, and the release of the July minutes might tell us what this was all about.  
$$$$
Also of interest is the Fed’s take on the Chinese equity situation, as that theme was front-and-center during the last Fed meeting.

FX Volatility in 2015: How Do Currencies Compare to Other Assets?	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/08/06/FX-Volatility-in-2015-How-Do-Currencies-Compare-to-Other-Assets.html	1438833960	"
Volatility, like leverage, is a double-edged sword for investors
$$$$
FX volatility more consistent than stocks, implied readings show
$$$$
Realized volatility lower in FX vs. Treasury bonds, commodities

$$$$
Volatility is a frequently misunderstood concept even by seasoned financial market professionals. While investors are reasonably wary of rapidly moving assets because of the increased level of risk they represent, they frequently overlook volatility’s benefits for generating trading opportunities. To the uninitiated, trading currencies seems to intuitively trigger fears of erratic price swings. A deeper look at how volatility levels compare across various asset classes reveals FX to be a sensible component for both long- and short-term portfolios.
$$$$
Benchmarking to June of 2014 – an extraordinary activity lull since 2007 – it can be seen that volatility levels across different asset classes have shown some extraordinary differences. The broader financial system started to churn broadly towards the end of 2014.However, not all assets would maintain this heightened level of action. For example, currency market volatility has held its buoyancy better than most.This has stemmed from the impact of divergent monetary policies as well as discrete events like the renewed Greece crisis. 
$$$$
By contrast, far more dramatic volatility spikesin the equity market have also faded more readily. Volatility in stocks – as represented by the VIX index – experienced a more exceptional increase in October and December, but has trended towards lower levels for most of 2015. If we look at an overlay of different volatility indices together we can see where activity levels started to diverge meaningfully across the financial assets. Comparing volatility levels for currencies against those of more ”traditional” markets, active traders can start to see different opportunities arise.  
$$$$
While volatility is appealing to the speculator, it should also be considered a measure of risk to positions. That said, the indicators shown above do not show the full picture. Volatility indexes like the S&P 500-based VIX reflect ”implied volatility”, which represents expected annualized price action. When we look at actual (typically called ”realized”) market movement, the picture looks different.
$$$$
Using a 90-day rate of change (ROC) to standardize movements across the different market types, we see the standings on what is volatile shift. Movements in commodity prices and government bond yields have proven exceptionally dramatic. Comparatively, equity levels are more restrained and EURUSD – as a benchmark for FX – is similarly reserved. Additional risk comes into the picture when we employ leverage on any of these assets, as is the standard amongst FX retail traders. However, the trader can control that gearing as well as position size more finely than in many other asset classes. 
$$$$
Overall, volatility is an important tool for all market participants as both a measure of return and risk. For the tactical and shorter-term “trader”, volatility is pursued more as a source of opportunity. In contrast, the passive and longer-term ”investor” looks to minimize volatility relative to projected returns (income) as much as possible. From both perspectives, FX is an asset class that deserves an important place in portfolios.

Non-Farm Payroll Comes Largely In-Line, Sinks EURUSD	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/08/07/July-NFPs-Hits-Expectations.html	1438953600	"
US economy added +215K jobs in July with an upward revision for June
$$$$
Unemployment rate stable at 5.3%
$$$$
EURUSD trades as low as $1.0859 after the report
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
Non-farm payrolls came largely in line with market expectations for July. The labor market added +215K jobs in July just missing 225K expectations by Bloomberg News economists. The July NFP came with an upward revision of +8K for last month – rising to 231K from 223K. The unemployment rate stayed stable at 5.3%. July NFPs were particularly important as the first of two NFP reports prior to the September FOMC – at which some speculators believe, a rate hike is possible.
$$$$
The strong jobs report came at the expense of the EURUSD pair, which plummeted, on the back of the data. EURUSD fell from $1.0972 just before the data to $1.0859 a few minutes after. The pair found support at $1.0857. EURUSD is currently trading at $1.0863 at the time of writing. 
$$$$
Here’s a summary of the critical jobs data on August 7, 2015:
$$$$
See the DailyFX economic calendar for a full summary of real-time economic data
$$$$
Nonfarm Payrolls is a monthly jobs report and considered the foremost economic indicator for the labor market in the US. Unemployment rate measures the number of individuals in the labor force without a job. Both data prints are priced highly by market participants due to the importance of the labor market in the US economy.

Stocks Surge Ahead of Jackson Hole	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/08/28/market-talk-8-28-2015.html	1440763860	"
Stock gains extended throughout yesterday as the global economy takes a step back from the ledge. 
$$$$
Fed policy and communication are proving of vital importance to equity performance, and the Jackson Hole Summit this weekend gives the Fed a chance to communicate support to markets. 
$$$$
A heavy week of data next week combined with a national holiday in China on September 3rd and 4th and Labor Day in the United States on September 7th, make for a potentially volatile environment. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Risk was most definitely ‘on’ throughout most of the trading day yesterday.  Led by gains in China, global equity markets popped higher with aggressive price action on the premise that the global economy isn’t melting down; at least not right now, anyways.  
$$$$
The Chinese trading session was quite similar to the day prior, in which stocks stayed within a relatively well-defined range for the early portion of the session, only to see a late-stage ramp ahead of the close. The Shanghai Composite (shcomp) closed higher by +4.82% and the Shenzhen Composite (szcomp) was up by +5.4%. This pop on the Shanghai Composite puts in the index back in positive territory year-to-date, showing a 1.38% return for 2015 (49.69% year-over-year).  
$$$$
Japan has also seen a nice ramp to go along with resurgence in Chinese and American markets, as the Nikkei crossed above the psychological 19,000 level, and is currently catching resistance on the under-side of a projected trend-line connecting the swing-lows since 3/31 of this year.  
$$$$
With the Chinese holiday on Thursday and Friday of next week, and Labor Day in the United States the following Monday – next week could be a rough time for short-position holders. The ramp in Chinese stock prices over the past two days speaks to the theory that the government may be supporting stock prices ahead of this national holiday. The following Monday could be extremely interesting in Asia given that the United States is on holiday.  
$$$$
Until then, look for breaks higher in the Nikkei or USDJPY to get long on these moves.

2. The Fed ‘has the market’s back’ ahead of Jackson Hole: The driving theme of the past two weeks has likely not been 100% China-related. Surely, a slowdown in the country could spell short-term weakness; but long-term there isn’t even really a question that China will be a bigger economy ten or twenty years down the road. The more likely driver here has been Fed policy, and more specifically Fed communication. Just two days ago, ahead of Mr. William Dudley’s comments that brought support into markets, I had written how what we’re seeing now is the ‘ugly under-belly of ZIRP’ as the Fed looks to normalize policy. The Fed has chosen to normalize policy by hiking interest rates, even though they’re sitting on a ballooned balance sheet from six years of QE. This despite the fact that headline inflation is running near-zero and unemployment numbers are presenting extremely low labor market participation. As in, while we may have seen some semblance of ‘recovery’ in the United States, the lack of inflation combined with low labor market participation and low wage growth has many thinking that this hasn’t really been a ‘great’ recovery yet, at least not one that warrants a rate hike just yet. 
$$$$
This most recent market tumble began with the release of Fed Minutes last Wednesday. These were the Minutes that were leaked a full 24 minutes ahead of the release and provided considerable confusion around whether the Fed was going to hike in September or not. This confusion, combined with weakness in Commodities and trouble in Chinese stocks provided enough of a catalyst for risk managers to eject from risky trades in a flight-to-quality. We saw many of these carries unwind, with EURUSD heading higher and USDJPY heading lower, as the world braced for impact.  
$$$$
But Mr. Dudley’s comments on Wednesday provided enough ammunition to bring in support. Mr. Dudley essentially said that the Fed ‘has our backs,’ by indicating that weakness in Oil and China makes a September hike look less likely. We’ve seen the S&P trade up by 120 handles since those comments, and the precipitous selling that marked trading early in the week hasn’t yet returned.  
$$$$
With the Jackson Hole Summit this weekend, expect to hear much more from the Fed. As for the S&P, there is a lot of room to run higher ahead of the national holiday in China and the litany of data for next week. 
$$$$
Created with Marketscope/Trading Station II; prepared by James Stanley
$$$$
3. Brace yourself for next week: Next week brings on RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia), ECB (European Central Bank) and NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls) – all reports that could bring considerable volatility into markets. With the Chinese national holiday on Thursday and Friday and Labor Day the following Monday, it’s worth noting again that extreme volatility could present itself over the next couple of weeks. 
$$$$
What are clear are risk-trends: If the world isn’t melting down and if stocks are moving higher, long USDJPY and short EURUSD are attractive themes. If we do have panic setting into the environment, then long EURUSD and short USDJPY become attractive.  
$$$$
This can be a prime environment for employing shorter-term strategies that allow for tighter risk management. Look to the shorter-term charts to afford a cheaper or tighter stop, and try to focus on increasing your average reward per dollar/pound/euro of risk. My fingertrap strategy can be one way of doing it, and for anyone that’d like to learn more this article will walk you through the entire strategy. You have to keep in mind that in these types of volatile markets, the probability of a reversal or a fast move is considerably higher than normal. So the odds of you getting on the right side of an extended move are even-lower. As a trader, you have to find a way to offset this higher degree of variability, and looking for bigger rewards when you’re right and smaller losses when you’re wrong is the most accommodating manner of doing so.

Fears of Financial Collapse Continue to Spread	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/08/24/Market-Talk-8-24-2015.html	1440417900	"
Another huge down-day in China saw the Shanghai Composite move down by -8.5%, the biggest one-day decline since the Financial Collapse in 2007. 
$$$$
Fear has enveloped the global economy, as weakness in Chinese stocks has spread to Hong Kong, Japan, Europe and the United States.  
$$$$
Numerous US Data reports this week are likely to set the tone for the dollar, but expecting action out of Beijing will likely be a bigger force on markets.  
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Panic has enveloped the global economy, led by Chinese stocks as the Shanghai Composite posted an -8.5% decline while the Shenzhen Composite sank by -7.7%. The severe sell-off on Friday led into a weekend in which many were expecting fresh announcements from Chinese regulators to counter the vicious price action seen in mainland equity bourses. But no ‘big’ announcements came, and this led to the largest one-day tumble in Chinese shares since the Financial Collapse in 2007. The decline in the Shanghai Composite brought the running tally to approximately -37% down from the mid-June highs.  
$$$$
While the weekend did not bring the expected reserve-requirement cut for Chinese banks, we did get an announcement that China was going to let their main state pension fund invest in the stock market for the first time ever. The fund will be able to invest up to 30% of its assets, currently ~$548 Billion (3.5 Trillion Yuan). This is a relative pittance compared to the amount of capital that’s been lost in this 37% tumble, as nearly $4 Trillion has been erased from Chinese stocks over the past two months. An overnight report in the Wall Street Journal that was really well-detailed was headlined by: ‘China to Flood Economy with Cash as Global Markets Lose Faith.’ 
$$$$
This is eerily similar to the overly-detailed Federal Reserve reports offered by the Wall Street Journal and Mr. Jon Hilsenrath; and the level of detail in this report makes it appear as if they have some well-placed sources within the Chinese government feeding details.  
$$$$
The bigger question at this point is whether the Chinese meltdown, and further the contagion of this meltdown can be countered with a single economy’s monetary policy. Stocks in Hong Kong were off an additional -5.17%, with Japan down -4.61%. We also saw massive Yen strength as the global flight-to-quality sees further unwind. I had written about the prospect of Yen strength in our Weekly Trading Forecast published on Friday. We’ve already crossed my 120 target, which I was expecting to take at least a week as we get Japanese CPI on Thursday night; but fear is continuing to permeate global financial markets ahead of the US open.  
$$$$
The losses in Hong Kong are so severe that they’re eliciting memories of the Asian Financial Collapse in 1997.    
$$$$

$$$$
2. Heavy week for US News: The economic calendar is full of US data early in the week: On Tuesday, we get consumer confidence followed by Wednesday’s Durable goods orders and GDP on Thursday. Given the dollar’s role in the recent rout, positive data could bring on sharp moves in the FX market. The US Dollar has shown considerable weakness since the release of last week’s meeting minutes that showed that the Fed was tenuously considering future rate hikes. The expectations for the September rate hike have slid since the minutes release, with investors now casting a gaze towards the December meeting. But the weakness that’s transpired since Wednesday now make even a December hike look a bit less likely.  
$$$$
One of the biggest questions that most investors and traders seem to have relate to the Euro – and why it’s moving higher with such aggression if this is a legitimate ‘flight-to-quality’ type of theme. The most likely answer is that we’re seeing unwind of carry trades. As the Euro became a viable funding currency with negative rates and a wide-ranging QE program, it became a favorite of traders looking to try to trap the carry. For an economy like the United States, that was looking at US Dollar strength on the back of expected rate hikes, the short EURUSD trade made a lot of sense. There was a clear divergence in monetary policy, and that was likely to continue for at least the next year.  
$$$$
But with a September rate hike, and perhaps even a December hike looking even less likely; we’ve seen the short EURUSD theme continuing to unwind. As clear evidence of risk-aversion, look to the 10-year yield in the United States which is now approaching 2%.  
$$$$
For those looking to pick on safe-haven themes – look to the Japanese Yen.  We’ve seen exuberant Yen strength, as the Bank of Japan gets backed further and further into a corner by actions from Chinese regulators:

$$$$
3. This is not the environment to be a ‘hero,’ markets will be here tomorrow:  As this sell-off becomes panic, mass media has begun to focus more and more on the potential for another financial collapse. And to be sure, the environment for such an event is there. But it’s important to keep in mind that fast markets can move in both directions, and Central Bankers around-the-world are not without firepower.  
$$$$
Go into this week fully expecting to see additional action out of China. The big question at this point is whether Chinese regulators’ actions will be dignified by support in stock markets throughout Asia, Europe and the United States.

Chinese Intervention Helps to Bring Back Risk-On	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/08/27/Market-Talk-8-27-2015.html	1440677400	"
Another climactic night of price action in Chinese stocks saw a late-session ramp bring a 6% move into the Shanghai Composite. 
$$$$
Comments from NY Fed President William Dudley helped to provide support to US stocks. 
$$$$
Risk-trends appear to be finding their way back into the market, including a potential short setup in EURUSD. 
"	"
Summary:
$$$$
1. It was yet another climactic night in China, but last night’s session ended on a considerably more positive tone than the gut-wrenching price action of the days prior. 
$$$$
At 2:10 AM EDT with fifty minutes to go, the Shanghai Composite was in negative territory by -.7% before a major ramp sent stocks screaming back into positive territory to close with a +5.3% gain. This put the Shanghai Composite (shcomp) back over the 3,000 psychological level, and has helped the global economy take a step back from the ledge, at least for now.  
$$$$
In a report this morning, Bloomberg shares information from an anonymous source that claims that the late-day ramp was due to government buying ahead of a September 3rd holiday and parade to celebrate the 70th anniversary of victory over Japan in World War II. After rate cuts and cuts to reserve requirements failed to bring support into stocks, a market meltdown has created considerable negative sentiment in the country. The report claims that the intervention was implemented to counter this sentiment by bringing some semblance of stability to Chinese stock prices ahead of this parade. 
$$$$
China’s markets will be closed on September 3rd and 4th (next Thursday and Friday) in observance of this national holiday. 
$$$$
Stocks in Hong Kong enjoyed a considerable portion of this rally, as a higher-low has been established at the 21,000 psychological level and higher-highs coming off of the 22,000 level. 
$$$$

$$$$
2. US Stocks go back into ‘Bull Mode’ after Dudley Comments: The early portion of US trade yesterday appeared as though ‘crash-like’ conditions may be coming back into the US stocks. But commentary from NY Fed President William Dudley, often considered one of the more dovish FOMC members helped to bring support into stocks.  
$$$$
The most recent rout in markets began with the release of Fed minutes last Wednesday. This is when US stocks started sliding, and finally broke below the 2,040 support level that had held the S&P 500 for six and a half months. As support levels started giving way, that’s when panic began to set in. With the sell-off in the early portion of US trade yesterday, it appeared as though Chinese stimulus was going to be fully priced-out of the market within a few days of being added in, but Bill Dudley stepped up to the plate and gave enough of a compelling case for buying stocks. Mr. Dudley said that a September hike was looking ‘extremely unlikely as a liftoff date.’ He also said that we were far away from QE4 discussions.  
$$$$
This helped to further evaporate expectations for that September hike, and opens the door for numerous discussions for creative implementation of monetary policy given the Jackson Hole meeting that begins today.  
$$$$
Created with Marketscope/Trading Station II; prepared by James Stanley
$$$$
3. Euro down-trend back in order? One of the brightest aspects of ‘panic’ leaving the market could be the return of risk-trends in markets. As in, those carry trades that have been unwinding en masse may be free to float back in their rate-driven order. Of specific interest is the EURUSD, as we’ve been getting lower-lows and lower-highs on the hourly chart; and price has just sunk into a previously strong support/resistance zone in the 1.1300 neighborhood. We’ve also just crossed back below the 200-day moving average, and breaks below this level could open up bearish setups to go short in the pair.  
$$$$
An important point-of-emphasis, as this has been a popular topic of recent: The Euro is not a safe-haven currency. There were many accusations of such as EURUSD ripped higher while panic and volatility was increasing, but as David Rodriguez laid out yesterday, this was more likely unwind of a carry trade as the Euro has become a viable funding currency. With fear permeating the environment, traders were compelled to close out the short EURUSD position for fear of bigger problems. To close a short position, one must buy and that equates to strength. After the EURUSD shed over ~3500 pips in 9 months on the back of European QE and break-up concerns, much of the market was left net-short. To the point where most anyone that wanted to be short EURUSD was short EURUSD, and it takes sellers to move prices lower.  
$$$$
With a sense of semblance coming back into the global environment, and with China supporting prices going into this September 3rd holiday and while the Fed meets in Jackson Hole – risk trends could be let free to come back into markets.

China Rips and Japan Dips While the World Awaits the Fed	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/08/market-talk-9-8-2015.html	1441715100	"
Chinese stocks ripped higher by 2.92% after posting a contraction in export data by -5.5%. 
$$$$
Japanese stocks sank by -2.43% after posting a narrower than expected GDP contraction. 
$$$$
USDJPY remains an attractive way to play the ‘risk on’ or ‘risk off’ themes across financial markets. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Chinese stocks pop after posting declining export data. After spending most of the session underwater with prices lower by as much as -1.44% on the Shanghai Composite, a late-session rally brought equity prices back into positive territory, with a closing gain of +2.92%. 
$$$$
The late-session rallies are becoming more commonplace in Chinese stocks, and many analysts point to these price action rallies as being government-backed; Goldman Sachs came out with a report over the weekend that suggested that Chinese authorities have already spent $236 Billion propping up the equity market since the rout began.  
$$$$
This rally in Chinese stocks came on the same day that export data showed a -5.5% decline from a year earlier (in USD terms), further highlighting the growing weakness that’s been showing up in various areas of the Chinese economy. This was a better-than-expected print, as analysts were looking for a -6.6% drop in exports and this was narrower than the -8.3% drop in July. Imports, however, came in disappointing with a -13.8% drop from an -8.1% decline the month prior.  
$$$$
Stocks in Hong Kong jumped on this late session rally as well, with the Hang Seng moving higher by 850 points in the last 4 hours of trading, sending the index higher by +3.28% on the day. 
$$$$

$$$$
2. Japan drops, Nikkei now flat on the year: In a conflicting set of data points; China posted disappointing export data while Japanese GDP indicated that the slowdown in their economy was lighter than initially thought, which would usually be construed as a positive. Japan’s GDP contracted at -1.2% in the 2nd quarter of this year, less than the -1.6% clip reported last month and better than analyst expectations looking for a -1.8% contraction. This sent Japanese stocks lower by -2.43% to snuff out the remainder of their gain for calendar year 2015. 
$$$$
With the contradictory reaction in stock prices to each of these data prints out of China and Japan, this further highlights the potential for stimulus-hopes to be that next driver of equity prices. This better-than-expected GDP revision out of Japan shows that the Japanese economy is contracting less than originally thought, and this may be construed as removing pressure from the Bank of Japan for increasing future stimulus; while the disappointing export data out of China could make it more likely to see additional actions out of Chinese regulators.  
$$$$
This could, thereby, strengthen the case of using the Yen as a primary way to play this theme of Asian-economic weakness. If looking to trade panic, traders can look to buy the Yen. If looking to trade the ‘everything will be ok’ theme, then traders can look to sell the Yen (or sell the Euro) under the premise that investors will sell lower-yielding currencies.  
$$$$
On the chart below, we have USDJPY 4-hour candlesticks with the S&P 500 added in blue. Notice the strong degree of correlation, as weakness in stocks has been moving along with strength in the Yen. For those looking to play panic, short USDJPY could be a favored candidate. However, for those looking to sell the Yen, areas such as GBPJPY or AUDJPY may be more attractive.  
$$$$

$$$$
3. Central Banks on the Docket: This week brings three different major Central Bank Announcements, with Bank of Canada and RBNZ tomorrow and the Bank of England on Thursday. Of particular importance will be the commentary provided by each of these banks on the recent slowdown in China and the impact of falling oil prices. As heavy commodity exporters, both Canada and New Zealand will likely have something to say on the topic.  
$$$$
But China and the continuing discussion around the September Fed meeting will likely dominate the discussion around financial markets this week, as China was closed for Thursday and Friday and the United States opens after a three-day weekend.  
$$$$
For situations such as this, trading around the US Dollar could be a favored way to go into the week. We discuss such a strategy in the article, the US Dollar Hedge. Traders can look for setups in which USD-strength looks attractive, such as EURUSD. EURUSD is currently working on a bear flag formation (up-trending channel during a bigger-picture down-trend), and traders can look to get short on breaks of this rising trend-line.

Chinese Inflation Beats, But Risk of Contagion Has Grown	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/10/market-talk-9-10-2015.html	1441888380	"
China saw a positive beat on CPI last night, although it may not be a very positive indication after looking inside of the data.  
$$$$
Japanese stocks took another big ride, but this time they turned lower. 
$$$$
Rising risks of a global recession have begun to get notice from investment banks, and Brazilian debt was downgraded less than 24-hours after a troubling report from Citigroup. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Positive Chinese CPI brings on lower stock prices:  It was another jagged night of price action in Chinese equities, but this time stocks finished lower for the day. The Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) closed down by -1.39% while the Shenzhen Composite (SZCOMP) traded lower by -1.58%. This breaks the two-day winning streak that Chinese stocks had posted and noticeably missing last night was the ‘late session ramp’ that saw Chinese stock prices pop by greater than 2% in the closing hours of trade. 
$$$$
On a positive note, Chinese inflation came out above expectations last night – printing at 2% for August (year over year), beating the expectation of a 1.8% print. The primary source of this additional inflation has been attributed to the rise in food prices, as pork prices increased by 19.6% over the past twelve months –this is one of the few commodities pricing higher due to low supply, and it adds additional pressure on an already sensitive Chinese economy. This 2% CPI print means that inflation is now outpacing the one-year deposit rate in China, equating to a negative ‘real’ rate of return. 
$$$$
On the other hand, Chinese Producer prices (PPI) came in with a 5.9% contraction (deflation). This means that factory deflation can push up borrowing costs for the industrial sector (which is critical to the Chinese economy). This further erodes future profits because wages rise with CPI, and PPI deflation represents the prices of products. This squeezes margins for producers.  
$$$$
While many economies around-the-world are looking and hoping for any signs of inflation, the positive beat we just saw out of China may be the type of ‘positive data’ that you don’t want to see. This weakness in equities spilled over into Japan, which remains one of the more attractive ways to play the theme of a Chinese slowdown.

2. The Japanese Rollercoaster Continues:  After yesterday’s +7.7% pop on the Nikkei, Japan put in another outsized move in the overnight session, this time moving lower by -2.5%. 
$$$$
This means that 10-day volatility levels are now greater on Japanese stocks than that of Chinese stocks.  After reports on Tuesday that the CSI 300 Index and CSI 500 Index Futures have essentially died due by lower volumes driven by increased margin requirements, tightened position limits and pending police probes into the activity of malicious short sellers, this further highlights the prospect of looking to Japan to play the ‘risk off,’ or ‘panic’ theme should risks continue to rise as the Fed walks towards that first rate hike.  
$$$$
The primary point-of-contention for Japan is their ability to keep up with Chinese stimulus. Given the investment already made into the ‘Abe-Trade’ over the past three years, numerous questions persist as to the ability of Japan to embark on yet another round of QE: QE that has already put in a significant drive on prices in both the Nikkei and USDJPY. Now with the Bank of Japan essentially monetizing every bond that’s printed in the country, there aren’t many assets left to buy to embark on another round of QE. USDJPY is trading 50% higher than before Abe took office and installed his ‘three legs’ approach.  
$$$$
Yen strength or weakness has been driven largely by QE and expectations for more QE. This expectation for QE combined with low rates and low rate forecasts helps to drive carry trade flows with a low-yielding yen. But as pressure in the global economy builds, and as Japan becomes more exposed by not weakening their currency while China is – risks for the country’s economy continue to grow.  
$$$$
What could get the Yen back in a track of weakness would be commentary towards more QE down-the-road. As of yet, the Bank of Japan hasn’t given any indication that their considering this, but as pressure builds for the Japanese economy, expect that we’ll begin to hear this topic in the not-too-distant future. 
$$$$
Short USDJPY and short Japanese equities are two of the most attractive ways to play ‘panic’ in the current environment.

3. Citigroup sounding the alarm bells: After nearly three months of panic in Asian stocks that’s began to bleed into the rest of the world, investments banks are starting to get on the theme. Citigroup came out with a report yesterday that pegged a 55% chance of some form of a global recession in the next couple of years driven by a Chinese slowdown. They cited sliding demand from emerging markets (looking squarely at China) as a primary source-of-concern.  
$$$$
Later in the day, Brazilian debt got cut to junk status by Standard and Poors, sending yields shooting higher as investors sold out of these bond issues. This puts even more pressure on a Latin American economy that’s already been hit hard by the decline in Oil prices. There were numerous reasons cited for the down-grade: An embattled and controversial president is trying to manage above-line inflation with astronomical interest rates (highest rates since 06), while also trying to manage a corruption scandal at the state-run energy firm, Petrobas.  
$$$$
This is how contagion happens. It’s a domino effect where one bad event leads to another that eventually becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Next week, we’ll hear from the Fed as to whether the American economy is strong enough to hike rates; and meanwhile much of the rest of the world battles just to stay above water.  
$$$$
For now – if looking to play panic, short Japanese stocks and short USDJPY remain attractive avenues: And if looking to play the ‘everything will be ok’ theme, then short EURUSD and long US Large-Cap stocks (SPX500 or US30).

Hopes for QE Provide Fuel for Asset Prices	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/03/market-talk-9-3-2015.html	1441281900	"
The European Central Bank left rates unchanged, as expected. But the press conference with Mario Draghi brings on renewed hopes for Central Bank dovishness. 
$$$$
NFP could present significant volatility tomorrow, as the US Dollar has traded directly into a rigid zone of support.  
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Will the ECB have more QE for the world? As much of the world hangs onto the prospect of economic stability by an extremely thin thread, Investors have begun looking to Europe for the additional stimulus to keep global markets afloat. After the Fed struck a hard line on the rate hike talk earlier in the year, investors began bracing for impact as it became clear that the Central Bank for the largest national economy was no longer looking to ‘support the market’ with bond purchases. When this expected tightening of policy ran into an extreme sell-off in commodities combined with an economic slowdown/market melt-down in China, this helped to create a rather brisk ‘fight-to-quality,’ that brought on fears of another Financial Collapse. But the world has caught its breath… and nothing has melted away, at least not as of yet.  
$$$$
So hope has turned to the European Union and the European Central Bank. The ECB has already left rates unchanged as expected, but the real matter of importance is the press conference that begins at 8:30 AM EDT. It’s largely expected that the ECB will lower their inflation forecasts, which could be a prelude to an increase in QE. While an expected announcement of QE is likely not in the cards today given that we’re likely just starting to see the impact of bond purchases on the European economy, Mario Draghi striking a dovish tone could set off a bout of risk-taking in markets similar to what we’ve become accustomed to over the past six years of debt-fueled asset price gains.  
$$$$
Draghi taking a dovish tone and the ECB lowering inflation forecasts would be bearish for the Euro. On the other hand, if inflation forecasts are not decreased and if Draghi takes more of a ‘wait and see’ approach to QE decisions – this could be bullish for the Euro.  
$$$$
In many currency pairs, the Euro finds itself at support: EURUSD is supported off of the 1.1200 level, EURJPY at 135 and EURNZD at 1.7650. The risk-reward from a technical standpoint is more attractive to the long side of the Euro.  
$$$$
On EURUSD specifically, breaks of 1.1200 could be construed bearishly, and traders can wait for support to give way to signal the potential for further weakness, and after support is cleared they can begin looking for resistance in that old zone of support before initiating short positions. On the long side, Fibonacci resistance at 1.1295 could offer an initial profit target level, and with ~35-40 pips of risk that could offer a 1-to-1.5 risk-to-reward ratio. 
$$$$

$$$$
2. Non-Farm Payrolls Due tomorrow at 8:30 AM EDT: The expectation is for a print of 217k jobs added to American Non-Farm payrolls and with the heavy dose of risk aversion sweeping the market – this may have a one-sided implication for US rate hike expectations.  
$$$$
A weak NFP print will likely further price out the odds of a September hike: While expectations have been decreasing mightily while the world braces for the impact of a hard China landing, September still isn’t completely off the table. A strong print, on the other hand, won’t likely budge those expectations for a September hike much higher. If we see a blowout number (like 300k+), we’re likely to get some element of confusion around markets, but the odds of a print this far out of expectations is very unlikely.  
$$$$
The last eight trading days have seen the US Dollar come screaming back to resistance, as investors loaded back into carry trades as it became apparent that a global market meltdown wasn’t imminent. NFP could give this the juice to finally break above 12,050; a level that we haven’t been at since April when the Fed began backing up those rate hike hopes. This is the period that many in the financial media are referring to as ‘The Fed’s best chance to normalize policy.’ With hindsight being 20/20, this may have been the case, as waiting for later in the year has merely exposed to the Fed to additional exogenous risks (like a Chinese slowdown).  
$$$$
Breaks over 12,050 are bullish, and one of the most ideal ways to play such a situation is to let the dollar break above resistance, and then wait for it to catch support in the same zone that had functioned as previous resistance. This may take a few days if we get a strong NFP number tomorrow.  
$$$$

$$$$
3. Cash is a position too:  With the potential for significant volatility in the cards over the next three-to-four trading days, it’s important to keep the big picture in mind: The trader’s job is to make money by forecasting future price movements. As anyone that’s ever traded out of more than a few positions knows, this can be difficult. Forecasting future price movements is less about prediction, and more about probabilities; and risk and reward always go hand-in-hand. When we enter a period such as we’re in, the probabilities of a strategy or any specific trade working out decreases because there is more uncertainty in the environment, and price action becomes more chaotic. 
$$$$
So while there are numerous setups out there that look attractive that could certainly be aided by an influx of volatility, keep the big picture and long-term goals in mind. You have to be ready to take quick stops in a fast market, or else you run the risk of one ‘bad’ trade wiping out the gains of five, six, or even seven winners. This is The Number One Mistake that Forex Traders Make; and this is likely an issue that traders in other markets suffer from as well, but unfortunately that type of retail trader data isn’t available for other markets for us to analyze.  
$$$$
Opportunities are infinite… Capital is not. If you miss a trade setup today, there will be plenty more tomorrow. But if you lose capital today, well it’s not just going to grow back by itself. For most traders, it’s much more preferable to miss a setup than to lose capital. For anyone that would like to learn more on the topic, we discuss further in The ABC’s of Risk Management.

NFP Disappoints Ahead of Looming Fed Decision	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/04/Market-Talk-9-4-2015.html	1441370700	"
NFP printed at 173k v/s an expectation of 217k; further highlighting potential signs of weakness in the global economy. 
$$$$
The Yen continues to trade as a favored safe-haven candidate. A recent break below the 120 level highlights its attractiveness in the event of risk-aversion. 
$$$$
A holiday weekend in the United States opens up additional risk as China opens after being closed for two days to end this week. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. NFP disappoints with a print of 173K jobs added to American Non-Farm Payrolls: This was a rather outsized miss as the expectation was for 217k jobs to have been added. This brings on relevance in the fact that it’s the last NFP report before we get to the September 16-17 FOMC decision on rate hikes.  Unemployment came in at 5.1%, which sounds good… but with Labor Force Participation at 62.6%, the lowest read since latter 1977. So this 5.1% unemployment rate isn’t nearly as attractive as it may first appear.  
$$$$
With strong employment being cited as a primary reason for the Fed looking to raise rates, this weak print may have just made that case ‘less strong.’
$$$$
Although contrary to this, Fed member Jeffrey Lacker made a statement shortly before the NFP release that may have nullified this theory by stating that he didn’t think this report would have significant sway over the September decision, and he reiterated his thesis that he felt rates should be hiked to reflect strength in the ‘real economy.’  
$$$$
The immediate reaction to the print has been USD-strength, as we’ve seen the greenback pose a quick break above the resistance zone that we identified yesterday. But sellers have quickly come back in the fold as the dollar inches towards new 4.5 month highs. The net impact of this NFP report, all factors equal, should bring on USD weakness. But given the multiple pressure-points in the global economy right now, there are numerous factors that can change this trajectory.  
$$$$
Pairs that look attractive for USD Strength: EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD

2. The Yen as a Safe-Haven: An interesting by-product of the recent panic that’s seeped into markets has been the vulnerability of the Yen as a safe-haven currency in the inevitable flight-to-quality that accompanies such panic-prone environments. The fact that really exacerbated this theme was China’s devaluation of the Yuan, and the fact that the Chinese currency was no longer going to trade in-line with the Dollar. This exposes Japan – because as a key trade partner of China, this cheaper Yuan would mean that Japanese goods are more expensive in China, thereby hitting Japanese exports; and Chinese goods are even cheaper in Japan, further dampening domestic spending on products made in the country. 
$$$$
This is the ‘beggar thy neighbor’ strategy that’s somewhat of the ‘elephant in the room’ of the global economy right now. With few ways to stimulate economies, many central banks have moved to competitive devaluations through QE vehicles in an effort to feed liquidity into lending markets. And while QE may have helped the global economy avert a system-wide collapse in 2008, it’s done little to satisfy economists in terms of ‘real growth’ and the only real inflation that’s been seen has been in stock prices. 
$$$$
Earlier in the week, the G-20 put out a statement that they’ve agreed not to ensue with competitive devaluations with each other. But if given the option to let an economy melt-down or to put in another round of QE, most Central Bankers would likely elect the latter route.  
$$$$
What makes Japan interesting is that they might have a difficult time doing another round of QE. At this point, their QE efforts are essentially monetizing every bond that the country prints. So if QE is to happen, what assets would the Bank of Japan buy?  
$$$$
This is what helps to make the Yen a strong candidate as a safe-haven currency in the event of further panic. USDJPY has traded from ~80 to as high as 125.00 on the back of Japanese QE. And with the country facing continued difficulty on the inflation and growth front, it doesn’t look as though ‘Abe-nomics’ has ‘worked,’ at least not yet. The ‘three legs’ approach to reviving the Japanese economy now looks like one leg and two twigs.  
$$$$
The 120 level is the current area of interest on the Japanese Yen, and the pair trading below this price highlights fear in the environment. The ‘panic’ theme would likely entail lower probabilities of a rate hike in the US (USD weakness), combined with the expected further devaluation of Yuan which would likely bring additional strength to the Yen; and perhaps most importantly Japan would see safe-haven flows directly as investors eschewed return on capital for return of capital; and with Japan one of the few nations that would actually be able to pay off all of their debts in a liquidation-type of scenario, Japanese government bonds would likely become attractive again (which would mean more buying of the Yen and Yen-based investments).  
$$$$

3. Monday could be VERY interesting – be extra careful with weekend risk: US markets are closed on Monday for Labor Day, and Chinese markets re-open after being closed for Thursday and Friday of this week in observance of a holiday and a military parade. Hong Kong opened back up for trading on Friday, and promptly traded down to a 2-year low on the Hang Seng Index (HKG33).  
$$$$
One of the most sensitive pressure points in markets right now is China, and the fear that a Chinese slowdown would bring the rest of the world into recession. Granted, the global economy looks as though it’s in a vulnerable space given the veracity of the equity sell-offs over the past couple of weeks, and what we’ve seen in the last 21 hours on the S&P hasn’t been constructive, as we’ve traded down by 50 handles since lunch-time yesterday in the US.  
$$$$
The crux of the matter is monetary policy: The world’s medicine has quickly become its detriment. Quantitative Easing was designed to prevent a credit lockup, to keep borrowing and lending flowing so that the world didn’t enter into a type of ‘global great recession.’ The United States embarked on three separate rounds of QE, as each time we came off of the medicine the economy became sick again. We finally ended QE last year, and since then the Fed has been talking about ‘normalizing policy’ to offset ‘excessive risk taking.’ Because one of the down-sides of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy) has been that investors had to search harder and harder for yields; building mini-bubbles in a lot of markets such as real estate (again), commodities (which seems to be busting already) and of course equity and debt markets. Making matters more difficult is that these ‘mini-bubbles’ are all over the world as opposed to just the United States.  
$$$$
So as the Fed began moving closer to ‘normalization,’ the world came to realize that the free ride on risk may be close to coming to an end. Even if we get one rate hike followed by a year of stability, this was a clear signal that the Fed was no longer supporting markets.  
$$$$
This is what’s exacerbated the Chinese concerns and the slowdown in Oil. The Fed is talking tough about raising rates and tightening policy while the rest of the world faces pressure. This has become so severe that one of the greatest market prognosticators of our time, Mr. Ray Dalio, has projected that we’d see another round of QE from the Fed before we get that first rate hike.  
$$$$
The early portion of next week could potentially see the ‘risk-off’ trade come back with gusto. In this case, look for weakness in stocks, strength in US, German and Japanese bonds combined with strength in Yen. The most attractive candidates for this theme are USDJPY, AUDJPY (given Australian exposure to China, GBPJPY and EURJPY.  
$$$$
Be very careful holding long equity trades going into this extended weekend.

Long Sterling as the Most Attractive Way to Trade FOMC	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/17/market-talk-9-17-2015.html	1442494200	"
Today is expected to bring high volatility around FOMC. The statement and rate decision are delivered at 2:00 PM, followed by the Press Conference at 2:30 PM. Expect high volatility around the release and press conference, and low liquidity from 2:00-2:30 while the world waits for Ms. Yellen to begin the presser. 
$$$$
Long GBP just became interesting again, as Mr. Mark Carney warned that rate hikes may be coming in early 2016.  
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. The Meeting we’ve All Been Waiting for is Finally Here: Today should be interesting. At 2 PM EDT we get the Fed Rate Decision, and at 2:30 we begin the press conference with Ms. Janet Yellen. This gap between the rate announcement and press conference could be treacherous for traders whether the Fed hikes rates or not. Expect volatility around 2:00 PM to be followed by low-liquidity conditions while traders wait for Ms. Yellen to begin speaking with the press. And at 2:30 PM, expect a constant onslaught of volatility throughout the press conference. The context with which the Fed delivers this decision could be as important as the decision itself.  
$$$$
Ms. Yellen hasn’t spoken in public for nearly two months. Economists and Analysts seem to be rather split as to whether the Fed will move through most opinion polls, while traders are less sure if we’re gauging Fed Funds Interest Rate Futures. In reality, nobody really knows what is going to happen. This is the type of data that can start new trends or provide highs and/or lows that can be used for stop placement for weeks ahead. There’s also a chance that today is a snoozer: In markets, you have to expect the unexpected.  
$$$$
What is probably fairly certain is the fact that the Fed doesn’t want to be the cause of a crash. And after the global economy caught its breath after the panic towards the end of August, the bank has had plenty of time to discuss how they’ll deliver this news, whatever it might be. So even if they hike, expect a large amount of dovishness to come along with it. This is where we’d expect to hear things like ‘gradual rise,’ or ‘data dependency,’ or things of that nature, indicating that another hike isn’t necessarily imminent just because we got one today. Alternatively, if they hold rates flat – expect this to come with a hawkish statement that will likely allude to a pending hike in October or December of this year. This is the scenario that Morgan Stanley began talking about earlier in the week that’s been dubbed a ‘hawkish hold,’ and this seems like a fairly likely outcome given expectations leading into the announcement.  
$$$$
As for which markets may be most opportunistic: Again the context will likely be the differentiator here rather than the binary decision of ‘did they hike/did they hold.’ If this meeting fires on risk-aversion, similar to what we saw at the end of August as Chinese slowdown concerns, falling oil prices and an impending rate hike created a flight-to-quality, then long Yen will likely be an attractive area to be positioned around. We discussed this theme yesterday in the article, The Yen as the Safe-Haven Vehicle of Choice. As for which currencies would be most attractive to match up with long yen, short Aussie, Kiwi and Cad could all be attractive candidates; and perhaps even EUR/JPY to the short side as well.  
$$$$
However, if we get a ‘risk on’ type of drive after the announcement – expect stocks to pop higher, along with Yen weakness and a return of the EUR/USD down-trend. Long GBP/JPY could be especially attractive with this theme, as a recent pickup in hopes for rate hikes in the UK could drive sterling flows against a weak Yen.  
$$$$
The past two days have seen the S&P 500 climb higher, and this speaks to my earlier statement towards confidence in the Fed. The one consistent theme that we’ve seen from the bank since the Financial Collapse has been their unmoving support. Traders buying stocks ahead of today’s announcement could be the manifestation of the expectation for that theme to continue.  
$$$$
My expectation is that we’re going to see a hawkish hold, and risk assets are going to fly higher for the time being until additional global pressures become more prominent.  
$$$$

$$$$
2. Long Sterling Just Got Interesting Again: One of the most attractive parts of the currency market is the fact that everything is traded in pairs. While this will often be a down-side for most newbies because it adds an additional component, after a trader realizes the luxury that this can provide – it’s often considered a pure benefit.  
$$$$
One of the reasons that pairs-trading can be great is the fact that dichotomies (differences) can develop between the economies represented in a currency quote that can allow for an elongated trend to develop. These are the types of trends that stocks or futures traders can often only dream of, because when a theme develops in the FX world, whether it’s a ‘flight-to-quality,’ or QE or a Central Bank embarking on some type of policy to try to juice their export balances – it can last for a really long time. And when this happens, such as a prolonged down-trend in the US Dollar or an extended up-trend in the USD/JPY – traders merely need to wait to ‘buy low’ or ‘sell high,’ to get on the ‘right’ side of the trend; and because these trends can potentially extend for even years (like USD/JPY has), traders can look to build positions while essentially trading in the direction of rate expectations. This is what leads to the carry trade, and this can be one of the most attractive long-term FX strategies.  
$$$$
Unfortunately, we haven’t had an attractive carry trade in the FX world since the Aussie topped out along with Gold in 2011. This is yet another consequence of ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy). But as we get nearer to a rate hike, this theme could be around-the-corner, or at least beginning to develop into early next year. 
$$$$
We’ve even got one of our first candidates in the Sterling. The British Pound has seen similar price action over the last two years as the UK was one of the few economies other than the United States seeing signs of growth. As these signs of growth became more prominent, and as the expectations for inflation grew, traders began increasing expectations for an eventual rate hike from the Bank of England. This created an up-trend that moved GBP/USD from 1.4814 all the way up to 1.7190 (the 2014 high). But as the Sterling got stronger, their economy grew weaker. So weak, in fact, that those same rate hikes hopes that drove the currency higher diminished and traders priced those out of the market, creating a down-trend that lasted for nine months and saw GBP/USD move from that 1.7190 top to a new-low of 1.4564.  
$$$$
Rate Hike Hopes Driving the British Pound
$$$$
Created with Marketscope/Trading Station II; prepared by James Stanley
$$$$
But of recent, those rate hike hopes are beginning to come back as the British economy is, once again, showing promise of growth. On Friday of last week, Ms. Kristin Forbes of the Bank of England warned that rate hikes may come ‘sooner rather than later.’ These are the types of comments that begin stoking rate-hike expectations. On Tuesday, British inflation printed at 0%, and the sterling moved lower, but yesterday UK Wage Growth printed at a +2.9% gain to re-fire those expectations. And later in the day, BOE Governor Mr. Mark Carney said that there was a chance that rates may need to be hiked in early 2016 if the economy continues to grow and inflationary pressures continue to increase.  
$$$$
This has fired strength in the British Pound against every currency, including the US Dollar, and this could be the initiation of the type of trend that could last for a while.  In my technical piece on the cable yesterday, I noted how GBP/USD has established higher-low Fibonacci support as these increased rate-hike expectations have been getting priced into the Pound. 
$$$$
While the US Dollar may be congested for the next few months while we walk through these rate-discussions in the United States, long Sterling could be a way for traders to look to trade the ‘risk on’ theme that Central Bankers have been so supportive of. More to the point, traders can look to avoid the dollar by going long Sterling against currencies such as the Japanese Yen, the Euro, or perhaps even the Canadian Dollar. These economies are all currently seeing weak internal economies that likely won’t be able to bear a rate hike anytime soon; and each may actually be looking at loosening policy in the coming months. This is a way to trade on the expected divergence between two economies through a currency pair.

Greece will hold a general election this Sunday to determine a new government. Following months of fear over the threat of a Eurozone exit through strained negotiations between former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and creditors in July, Tsipras was forced to give into bailout terms in August. Shortly after the agreement was struck, Tsipras stepped down as Greece’s Prime Minister paving the way for the upcoming election. 
$$$$
The key parties leading into the are Tsipras’ Syriza party and the New Democracy party led by Vangelis Meimarakis. Other parties looking to take win seats are the Pasok, Golden Dawn, Potami, and the Popular Unity parties. Recent polls show a higher ranking for Syriza though after three weeks of campaigning its closest rival has stayed within a thin margin, with one survey by Alpah TV putting Syriza at 26.2 percent and New Democracy at 25.1.
$$$$
Despite the lead, it is not expected either will gain enough votes needed to secure a majority in the 300-seat parliament. If no party can gain the majority it is likely that a coalition between the parties will be necessary – a notion that EU leaders are hoping for. While Tsipras has ruled out the possibilities of a pact with the New Democracy party, a win by Syriza will give them an extra 50 seats which could help it form coalition with other, closer-minded parties.
$$$$
Alexis Tsipras was elected Prime Minister in January behind the Syriza party promise to end bailouts and austerity measures for Greece. It was a promise that many felt was broken after he agreed to terms for a new bailout program following the Greek referendum in July. At its conclusion, this weekend’s vote will be the third election held in Greece this year, second for Prime Minister, which has added to the sense of instability in Greece and underlying difficulties with navigating a recovery in the Eurozone. The constant change of leadership and government instability has taken its toll on Greece’s GDP growth as 2Q nominal GDP fell by 0.7 percent q/q. The next Prime Minister will have to oversee strict reforms related to the 86 billion euro bailout leaving concern over Greece’s ability to put together a stable government quick enough to manage.
$$$$
Since Alexis Tspiras stepped down in August the EURUSD has maintained a relatively tame range. That is a significant shift from the volatility generated by the country’s headlines in the weeks and months leading into the most intense period of the bailout negotiations.

Stocks Rise Ahead of FOMC, Uncertainty Reigns Supreme	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/16/market-talk-9-16-2015.html	1442406960	"
Chinese stocks put in an out-sized late-session ramp in the last hour-and-a-half of trading. 
$$$$
UK Wage Growth prints at 2.9%, reviving hopes for inflation in the British economy. 
$$$$
With FOMC on the docket tomorrow, traders should begin planning their exposure for the release. All markets and positions could be susceptible to a noticeable up-tick in volatility. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. The Late Session Ramp was Back with Gusto: In yesterday’s piece, we noted how the late-session price action surges that have become commonplace on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Composites were noticeably over the past few days. Well, last night those themes came back with aggression. After spending much of the session treading water, Chinese stocks rocketed higher with an hour and twenty minutes left in the session. For the Shanghai Composite, this was a critical move as the index spent the entirety of the session trading around the 3,000 psychological level that we’ve been discussing as ‘line-in-the-sand’ support. 
$$$$
The Shanghai Composite (shcomp) closed with a +4.89% gain while the Shenzhen Composite (szcomp) put in a +6.52% incline. Only 12 stocks out of the over 1,100 issues on the index were down on the day. This strength led most markets throughout Asia higher, and gains have come into many European issues as well as American stock index futures ahead of the open.  
$$$$
With a pivotal Fed meeting on the calendar for tomorrow afternoon, be very careful towards chasing prices ahead of such a big release. The more anticipated a release is, the more likely that we’ll see noise ahead of the data; and some investors have been looking to this meeting for three years when the Fed began mentioning September 2015 as a target date for a rate hike.  
$$$$
It’s also likely that we’ll see traders attempting to position themselves ahead of big releases. This means they could sell out of long positions or buy to cover shorts so that they’re not carrying as much exposure into a ‘risky’ period in the market: This can create noisy signals that traders regret taking after-the-fact. 
$$$$
Remember that in trading, opportunities are infinite. Capital, most definitely, is not. It’s much better to miss out on an opportunity than to lose capital because there will be more opportunities tomorrow, and capital doesn’t just grow back on its own.

2. UK Wage Growth stokes hopes for inflation: After UK inflation printed flat yesterday (1% for Core Inflation), the Sterling sold off as rate-hike hopes were further diminished for the British economy; and this came after Ms. Kristin Forbes commentary on Friday that said that hikes in the UK would like come ‘sooner rather than later.’ 
$$$$
But in a release this morning, UK Wage Growth printed a 2.9% gain that built back hopes for a rate hike early next year. The Sterling has put in an outsized rally since the release, with GBP/USD moving higher by ~100 pips while GBP/JPY has put in a ~180 pip gain. 
$$$$
The allure of such a situation is that in a world that’s seeing most economies embark on looser monetary policy, there are few currencies that look attractive to buy against expected weakness. The US Dollar was the sole outlier from July of 2014 leading into the second quarter of this year, as the tapering of QE and impending rate hikes led investors into buying the dollar. Hand-in-hand, we had weakness in GBP and EUR as this monetary policy dichotomy was expected to continue growing. GBP/USD went down by over 2,500 pips during this move, and EUR/USD was down by over 3,000 as investors sold Euro’s ahead of European QE in favor of US Dollar strength.  
$$$$
With all of the banter around lift-off, gradual rises, and ‘data dependency,’ the picture for the US and the Federal Reserve has become cloudier. If the UK can solidify economic strength in the coming months, this could highlight the attractiveness for long GBP against currencies that are expected to weaken on QE and looser monetary policy.

3. FOMC Strategy: Anyone around the financial world has been inundated with media around tomorrow’s Fed meeting, to the point where even critical prints such as this morning’s US CPI number or yesterday’s Advance Retail Sales have become marginalized while much of the world waits on the Fed.  
$$$$
This is as messy of a decision as I’ve ever seen; because in the past the data or markets have pretty much shown the Central Bank what they should do; with errors only becoming evident far after the fact. Like Greenspan hiking rates too slowly to offset ‘irrational exuberance’ seen in stocks during the Tech Boom (which quickly became the Tech Bust); or hiking rates too slowly to cool off the ‘housing boom’ that created an enormous bubble within the American economy. On the other side, the Fed has arguably been too slow to cut rates to offset the tech bust or the financial collapse, to the point where we had to have emergency Fed meetings to throw in 425 basis points (4.25%) worth of rate cuts in a year between December of 2007 and December of 2008.  
$$$$
The big difference is that this time, the Fed is leading the way. Nobody in the world knows how this will turn out. And even if you did know what Ms. Yellen was going to say tomorrow, there would be no way of predicting how exactly the market would price-in this information; making tomorrow’s Fed meeting a double entendre of risk. And while this may feel exciting or give an extra pulse of adrenaline in the morning, trading professionally isn’t about being excited. It’s about being professional. 
$$$$
So, if you don’t have a strategy that can manage your risk throughout the next couple of days, it’s highly recommended that you tread lightly. This is ‘the fast lane’ of finance, and while prices can put in big moves really fast, Traits of Successful Traders illustrates how most retail traders do worse in volatile conditions.  
$$$$
One of the best feelings in the world is being cash-heavy after a huge decline (such as 2008) so that you can swoop in and buy when prices are at rock-bottom support. Surely, this strategy won’t work out every time, as prices may ascend without your participation and you’re left sitting on your hands; but if given the option between being prudent or taking a loss, traders should always elect the route of least resistance.

Setups Abundant in the Wake of FOMC	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/21/market-talk-9-21-2015.html	1442842500	"
The Fed gave us the ‘hawkish hold,’ last week, but the reality of tighter monetary policy from the United States is unavoidable. 
$$$$
Risk-trends appear to be re-forming as USD strength has been staging a remarkable turn-around since pre-US open on Friday. 
$$$$
Traders can use a low-data week to position for the weeks ahead, and there are numerous setups for both ‘risk on’ and ‘risk off’ themes. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. Last week was big:  We heard from the Fed, and we received the ‘no hike’ announcement that many were hoping for, and then we saw stocks around-the-world sell-off.  This is the exact opposite of what many were expecting, as word of additional ‘especially accommodative’ policy has been the fuel for strength in stocks and risk-markets for the past six years.  
$$$$
The big takeaway from last week’s FOMC announcement is that rate hikes are coming. As Ms. Yellen said during the press conference, the bank wants ‘just a little more time.’ We’ve heard from three different Fed officials since Thursday’s FOMC announcement indicating as such. San Francisco Fed President John Williams, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker all spoke with a hawkish tint towards the additional Fed meetings on the calendar for this year, with numerous statements from each that indicate a hike in 2015 is in the cards. Those meetings are in October (no press conference scheduled) and December, and as Ms. Yellen had said on Thursday, all meetings are ‘live meetings,’ and can bring a change in rates.   
$$$$
The US Dollar has moved along with this news. The initial reaction was aggressive USD weakness, as rate expectations were hit almost immediately with this dovish tone taken on by the Fed. The selling in the greenback continued through Asia and into Europe, but by 5AM EDT the following morning, the US Dollar had found a bottom and began ascending higher. This strength has continued all the way into this morning, and now the US Dollar is almost as high as before FOMC, shown on the chart below: 
$$$$
Created with Marketscope/Trading Station II; prepared by James Stanley
$$$$
2. Higher rates from the US (and strong rate expectations for coming quarters) could bring back one of the most attractive themes in markets: The Carry Trade. 
$$$$
We’ve already heard from Goldman Sachs on this theme: After the hawkish hold last week, Goldman came out with a forecast built around additional European weakness. At the last ECB meeting, Mario Draghi indicated that the European Central Bank could ratchet up European QE to offset weakness in the economy, and with the Fed taking on a hawkish stance and looking to begin tightening policy in the coming months, a strong deviation could develop between the Euro and the US Dollar. Goldman made a call that the Euro may drop up to ten cents (1,000 pips) against the US dollar as the ECB looks to ratchet up their stimulus to try to meet inflation targets. This means that the ECB would need to extend their current €60 Billion/month program through the end of 2016, and perhaps even running the program into mid-2017.  
$$$$
More-to-the-point, this divergence in monetary policy (ECB loosening policy while the Fed tightens) could open up an extremely attractive long-term position on the short side of the Euro. This could mean resumption in the down-trend that started with the announcement of European QE in May of 2014 and ran for over 3500 pips into March of this year. Since then, EUR/USD has been channeling higher (in a ‘big picture’ bear flag formation, indicated with a red label on the below chart: 
$$$$
Created with Marketscope/Trading Station II; prepared by James Stanley
$$$$
Notice that within the ‘bigger picture’ bear flag is a shorter-term, more abbreviated bear flag formation that had been setting in since the beginning of September (as indicated by the green label). That shorter-term bear-flag is in the process of breaking as the support line of the channel is beginning to give way. We caught support on the bottom of this channel to close out last week, and this week opened with a test of resistance off of previous support as sellers drove prices lower. 
$$$$
In the scenario in which risk-trends return as normalcy finds its way back into markets, the short EUR/USD trade could become one of the most attractive as this clear dichotomy in monetary policy between Europe and the United States would be expected to continue as the US looks to continue rate hikes into 2016 while Europe looks to improve inflation by embarking on currency-weakening policies.
$$$$
3. Similar themes on the Yen, but with slightly more fear: Another bank faced with the dire prospect of weak inflation is in Japan. Three years of Abe-nomics and Japan is still unable to come anywhere near the 2% inflation target that they’ve set. The Long USD/JPY trade was one of the most attractive markets to be in from Q4 2012 as Shinzo Abe ushered in his ‘three legs’ approach to shoring up the Japanese economy. The only leg of the three that seemed to work out was QE, and with a contracting economy facing even more pressure from a Chinese slowdown, it’s rational to assume that the bank might look at even more Yen-intervention in the not-too-distant future.  
$$$$
This has set up a fairly strong correlation between US Stocks and USD/JPY. The ‘Risk-Off’ or ‘panic’ type of environment has brought on significant Yen strength as US stocks have sold off. We discussed this topic at more length in the article, The Yen as the Safe-Haven Vehicle of Choice. And when calm does return, stocks have shown a tendency to drift higher along with the Dollar-Yen. The theme behind each of these moves is fairly aligned; as a growing and healthy economy that would denote higher stock prices would see rate hikes from the US before Japan, with perhaps even another round of Japanese QE as their economy attempts to turn the corner. While on the flip side, a ‘risk-off’ type of market that would see stock weakness would likely spell an unwind of the carry trade in the USD/JPY that’s seen the currency pair move up by more than 50% in the past three years. The chart below highlights the pair with recent levels of interest. The lines-in-the-sand on the pair are 121.50 for ‘risk-on’ or strength, with prices below 119.00 indicative of ‘risk-off’ or ‘panic,’ in the USD/JPY market. 
$$$$

$$$$
4. One bank that may be set and ready to hike is in the UK: While much of the financial world was watching the Federal Reserve last week, the Bank of England did a beautiful job of positioning itself for rate hikes in early 2016. On Friday of the previous week, Ms. Kristin Forbes of the MPC made mention that rate hikes for the UK ‘may be coming sooner rather than later.’ And last week, UK wage growth printed at a six-year high followed by comments from BOE president Mr. Mark Carney that hikes were looking likely in early 2016. We discussed this theme in more depth last week in the article, Long Sterling as the Most Attractive Way to Trade FOMC.  
$$$$
Like the United States, the UK is one of the few economies seeing signs of growth. And also like the United States, the UK has been sitting on near-flat rates for years while instituting Asset Purchase programs with the design of bringing inflation into their respective economies. It seems like all of that work is beginning to pay off, as the initial signs of inflation (and hopefully growth) are beginning to show in the data prints (this is why such a heavy focus has been on wage growth – the precursor to inflation). 
$$$$
And while the UK (or the US for that matter) might not be ready to hike rates tomorrow, there is a clear divergence between these economies and those in Europe, China or Japan where lackluster growth and meager inflation will likely need to be offset with even more ‘extraordinarily accommodative’ monetary policy.  
$$$$
From a technical perspective – GBP/USD is at an interesting place. The bullishness in the Sterling last week and the strong pop higher after FOMC has created a new short-term up-trend with higher highs and higher lows; and the projected trend-line connecting the lows of May to the lows of August is functioning as near-term resistance in the Cable. We’re currently supported on the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the most recent ‘major move.’ Traders can look for support to develop at the early portion of this week at or above the 1.5450-1.5515 zone before triggering long. 
$$$$
Created with Marketscope/Trading Station II; prepared by James Stanley
$$$$
Alternatively, traders can look for a ‘cleaner’ way of trading GBP-strength by avoiding the US Dollar altogether. For this theme, long GBP/CAD, GBP/AUD, GBP/NZD and short EUR/GBP could prove attractive, as monetary policy divergence could be expected to continue between the UK, Europe and Commodity-bloc currencies.

Japan Deflates While Yellen Reiterates 2015 Rate-Hike Plans	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/09/25/market-talk-9-25-2015.html	1443186120	"
We saw headline inflation for Japan print at -.1% for August, the first deflationary print since April of 2013 for the Japanese economy. 
$$$$
Ms. Janet Yellen reiterated the Fed’s 2015 rate hike plans in a scheduled speech yesterday. 
$$$$
Stocks around-the-world are up after a heavy week of intra-day volatility, and with a heavy schedule of data announcements for next week, that volatility is likely not over yet. 
"	"
Summary: 
$$$$
1. This week saw considerable intra-day volatility across markets as equities continued to struggle in the wake of the FOMC’s hawkish-hold. In Ms. Janet Yellen’s speech yesterday, she laid out a detailed strategy for the Fed’s rate hike plans this year, trying to offer more clear communication after last week’s statement and press conference drove risk-off trends around-the-world.  
$$$$
The big takeaway from this speech was US Dollar strength against most currencies as the Greenback staged a run towards the September high. As the Fed moves closer to hiking rates in 2015, expect flows to continue moving into the Dollar as this is one of the few areas in which investors may be able to forecast higher rates in the not-too-distant future. This could also equate to additional weakness in EUR/USD and strength in USD/JPY as traders look to play the dichotomy in monetary policy between these economies. In Europe and Japan, inflation has been under-performing to the point that many have begun to anticipate additional stimulus from these Central Banks. 
$$$$
This leads to the alignment of risk-trends across asset classes in which equity strength under the presumption of American economic health brings higher stock prices, a stronger dollar, a weaker Euro and a weaker Yen. This may also bring GBP-strength, as many traders are expecting the UK to raise rates shortly after the US as this is one of the few other economies seeing actual inflationary pressures inside of their economies.  
$$$$
The under-side of this dollar strength is the fact that continued strength in the Greenback will eventually hit American exports (making American exports more expensive internationally, and making imports cheaper by comparison), which will eventually hit American corporate earnings (which are the closest things to a direct driver of stock prices). But those are issues for down-the-road, as the Fed is trying to divert a disaster here.  
$$$$
Should that disaster-like mentality envelop equity markets, and given next week’s slate of data, it could – traders can look to play risk aversion trends by looking at short stocks, and short-USD against the Euro and Yen as rate-hike and stimulus bets unwind previously well-established trends. This would be long EUR/USD and short USD/JPY as those longer-term, bigger-picture trends unwind should risk aversion continue to increase.  
$$$$
In the chart below, we’re looking at potential resistance levels on the US Dollar. We’ve just set a 5-month high, and after that we could see resistance at 12,149 (the March 2015 high) and just above at 12,162 (the 12-year high on the FXCM Dow Jones Dollar Index). 
$$$$

$$$$
2. Japan deflates: Plunging oil prices have snared another victim, as the Bank of Japan reported negative inflation for the month of August, printing at -.1%. CPI less food and energy, printed at .8%, far below the bank’s 2% annual inflation target. The fact that Japan continues to miss inflation targets while the stimulus engines are running at close-to-full steam has created the theory in markets that Japan will roll out more stimulus in the future. The problem is that Japanese QE, in its current form, would be difficult to expand as the bank is monetizing every bond that they’re printing. The prevailing thought is that any additional QE-overtures would be directed at local government debt and projects bonds in an effort to revive the municipal economies within Japan, hoping that a collective revival of the smaller economies within Japan would spell a groundswell of growth for the larger economy as-a-whole. 
$$$$
This sets up the Yen to be an attractive way to play current ‘risk-on’ and ‘risk-off’ themes. As health returns to markets and as stocks stage higher, expect the USD/JPY to do the same as stimulus bets for Japan increase while rate-hike expectations continue to move higher for the American economy. And as ‘risk-off’ themes envelop markets, look for stocks to move lower along with USD/JPY as rate hike bets for the United States diminish along with stimulus bets for Japan. We discussed this theme in the article, the Yen as the Safe-Haven of Choice, and the same type of theme could be applied to the Nikkei, which set a new 8-month low intra-day during yesterday’s trading session. 
$$$$

$$$$3. The Calendar is loaded for next week – expect volatility: Many headlines this morning are indicating that order has been restored after Yellen delivered a cleaner message from the Fed on rate hike plans for 2015. Be very careful with this logic… 
$$$$
Next week is loaded with high-impact data, and with the moves and volatility seen this week we are likely seeing traders square-up positions ahead of a heavy week of data. Rebounds and retracements will often take place in these environments, which is what makes day-trading on non-NFP Fridays complicated, as trends that define price action for the previous week give way reversing prices as traders protect profits. 
$$$$
There are high-impact announcements every day next week, and we’re seeing data out of the United States, Europe, Canada, and China: All economies that have been ‘pressure points’ across markets. Of specific note – we’re getting European inflation data next week, and this can be a big determinant for how traders price in future-stimulus hopes for the continent. Expect bad news to be good here (for risk trends), as under-performance in inflation would increase hopes for additional stimulus, which would likely drive the single currency lower. Positive prints would spell the opposite; or diminished hopes for future additions to the ECB’s stimulus campaign.  
$$$$
Canadian GDP comes out on Wednesday with Chinese Manufacturing PMI on Thursday. And on Friday – we get ‘the big one’ with Non-Farm Payrolls with an expectation of 200,000 jobs to have been added to American payrolls during the month of September.  
$$$$
And for the United States, we have plenty of data. We may finally be in a space where ‘good is good’ on the US data front, as positive data prints would equate to strong rate-hike expectations, which should drive USD-strength. 
$$$$
Below, we’re looking at the high-impact announcements scheduled for next week. With markets on edge and after many fits and starts to volatility this week there is a large amount of uncertainty out there. Be extremely careful navigating through the next weeks’ worth of data.

Optimism Remains for Last Minute Greek Deal	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/06/26/EURUSD-Saturday-Summit.html	1435347000	"
Reports Out of Europe Suggest Greek Deal Still Possible at EU-Summit.
$$$$
Greek Officials Continue Expresses Frustration Behind Proposals From Creditors.
$$$$
Creditors, Eurozone Finance Ministers, and Greece talks continue at 12:00GMT on Saturday.
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
The inability of Greece and its creditors to compromise in the last few months has set the stage for a vital meeting on SaturdayJune 27 at 12:00GMT. German Chancellor Angela Merkel argued “tomorrow’s meeting is of decisive character” as the June 30 payment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) quickly approaches. Athens could potentially receive &euro;15.5 Billion in bailout funds that would cover the bundled payment and give the Greek government greater scope to service its debts with payments to the European Central Bank (ECB) coming up in July.
$$$$
Sentiments heading into this crucial meeting appear to be optimistic as European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker sees “a real chance to conclude an agreement.” However, if Tsipras fails to clinch an agreement on Saturday and Greece is forced to default on the IMF bundled payment, capital controls may be imposed, which would prevent an immediate bank run, but the renewed threat for contagion may grip trader sentiment as Greece stands at risk of losing access to the ECB. 
$$$$
Despite the threat of a Greek event, recent price action in EUR/USD suggest market participants are largely optimistic on Greece especially as the pair preserves the opening weekly range and continues to close above key support around $1.1120-30, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. In turn, a positive development may spur a run towards the monthly high ($1.1435) amid the easing threat for contagion.
$$$$
However, a greater threat for a Greek default/exit may produce increased volatility at weekly open along with market participants staging a flight to safety. A dismal outcome in Greece may lead EUR/USD to give back the advance from earlier this month ($1.0886) , with a growing risk for a resumption of the long-term bear trend.

Athens Debates Proposals Ahead of Critical Weekend	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/07/10/Greece-Pre-Summit-7-10.html	1436564100	"

Finding cabinet support, parliament is now weighing the proposalswith fresh austerity

Greek banks, believed to be at critical levels of liquidity, need deal to avoid immediate crisis 
"	"
Talking Points
$$$$
The International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, and Eurozone (collectively known as The Institutions) received Greek proposals before the imposed deadline. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, President of the Eurozone, confirmed the proposals arrived overnight, and the Eurozone could make a “major decision” on the Greek crisis during Saturday’s meeting. Dijsselbloem conducted a conference call with IMF chief Christine Lagarde, ECB President Mario Draghi, and European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker. He also indicated he is awaiting technical analysis on the latest proposals before commenting.
$$$$
For over five months, Greece and its creditors have been at odds on a potential Greek deal to bailout the debt-stricken country on its payments. Following the referendum, which sent a strong message of support against further austerity, the Athens Parliament is now weighing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s proposals (which can be explained in full detail here). Government support will be critical to winning support from creditors – though the local vote alone cannot secure it. Newly appointed Greek Finance Minister claimed Greek proposals are “better than Juncker’s plan”. 
$$$$
Meanwhile, Greek banks - which have been closed for two weeks now - were issued a warning by Christian Noyer, an ECB governing council member. He cautioned, if an agreement isn’t reached by Sunday’s summit the ECB may be forced to pull the plug on emergency liquidity funds. The current cap on ELA funding 
$$$$
In response to the shortage of liquidity, Greece has imposed capital controls further weakening the economy. Euclid Tsakalotos said in a speech to parliament, “Greek capital controls can be quickly reversed”. A senior Greek banker quoted by Reuters claimed that - assuming a deal is reached - Greek banks will reopen by the end of next week and need a capitalization of &euro;10-€14 Billion Euros. 
$$$$
All eyes will be on the Euro this weekend due to the vitality of the meetings; first Finance Ministers will meet to discuss the proposals, followed by a European Union summit of 28 countries. European equity markets have been heartened by optimism with France’s CAC, and Spain’s Ibex climbing over 3%. Germany’s Dax and Italy’s FTSE MIB ascended 2.9%, and 3% respectively. Crowds remain net-short on the EURUSD pair despite recent progress on a deal being achieved this weekend.

Bundestag Approves Greece Bailout, ESM Agrees in Principle for Negotiations	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/07/18/Bundestag-Approves-Greece-Bailout-ESM-Agrees-in-Principle-for-Negotiations.html	1437171720	"

European Council approves &euro;7.16 Billion bridge financing – funds transferred Monday
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
The Bundestag cleared the final hurdle in beginning formal bailout negotiations by approving Greek reforms in exchange for an €86 Billion Euro-members package. Lawmakers voted 439-119 in favor for the deal shaped at last Sunday’s EU delegates’ summit. German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated ahead of the vote, “The alternative to this agreement would not be a ‘time out’ from the Euro… but rather predictable chaos.” 
$$$$
The Board of Governors of the European Stability Mechanism ratified a request to grant Greece aid. The country’s creditors will thereby begin discussing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to outline macroeconomic reforms and policy conditionality on the reported €86 Billion loan. EC Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in his statement, bailout negotiations would be between Athens and the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund, and Eurozone (collectively known as The Institutions). 
$$$$
As of yesterday morning, the EU agreed in principle to a bridge loan for Greece’s short-term financing. Dombrovskis confirmed the European Commission has agreed to send €7.16 Billion to Greece by Monday. The figure will allow Greece to make the critical ECB bond repayment of €3.5 Billion, and clear arrears with the International Monetary Fund on €2.01 Billion for two, separate missed payments.
$$$$
As of Friday morning, EURUSD set its second consecutive monthly low in two days. Through the day, the EURUSD traded as low as 1.0830 - a new monthly low for a pair that is down significantly on the year and has fallen dramatically over the past 15 months. Even after encouraging news on a Greek bailout, fresh emergency liquidity for Greek banks, and a bridge loan, the Euro fails to find solid footing.

Bundestag voting on bailout terms tomorrow – final step before formal bailout negotiations
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
Greek parliament accepted terms for a third bailout yesterday and received two essential cash infusions. European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis announced, “There is an agreement in principle on EFSM-based bridge financing.” An EC representative confirmed the loan would be €7 Billion, from which Athens can remove itself from arrears on two missed International Monetary Fund loans payments and cover a €3.5 Billion tab to the European Central Bank on July 20th.
$$$$
As of this morning, ECB President Mario Draghi approved an emergency liquidity request for the Greek banking sector. The ECB will increase its current €88.6 Billion cap by €900 Million. The increase in ELA won’t be enough to lift capital controls; but according to a senior bank official, Greek banks will reopen Monday – after a three-week bank holiday. 
$$$$
Following the ECB announcing that it had kept its monetary policy efforts unchanged at its regularly scheduled meeting, Draghi remarked on Greece in his press conference, “all my evidence leads me to say we will be repaid as well as the IMF” on July 20th. Draghi added he believed debt relief for Greece is, “necessary”. However, ahead of the Bundestag vote on the third bailout (in five years), German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told lawmakers there will be no debt cut for Greece. He considers “reprofiling” Greek debt is only an option after 2022. 
$$$$
In addition to the increased austerity Greece must impose, Eurozone creditors demanded a collateral asset fund which will include “valuable Greek assets” in exchange for the bailout funds. Today, President of the Eurozone Jeroen Dijsselbloem said a €50 Billion target is “realistic”. The statement by the creditors said, Greek assets will be placed in the fund, and subsequently sold over the duration of the bailout. 
$$$$
EURUSD experienced a modest swell at 13:00GMT following Mario Draghi’s press conference. The pair found support at $1.085 before climbing to $1.092 just an hour later. Forex traders remain bearish on the pair and look for concrete signals of the Euro’s fundamental backdrop.

After the Bundestag and European Stability Mechanism, approved Greek bailout measures, negotiations between Greece and its creditors can commence on a potential three-year €86 Billion loan. German delegates continue to maintain a “classic haircut” is out of question for Greece while IMF and ECB chiefs regard debt relief as an integral part to the bailout. Greece’s total debt stands at €356 Billion and is considered unsustainable. Meanwhile, Greek citizens are already feeling the increased austerity as the value added tax for basic goods has increased by 10% since 2011. The current VAT for basic goods stands at 23%.

Greece Negotiations Restart, New Proposals Expected Tomorrow	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/07/07/Greece-Summit-7-7.html	1436304600	"
EU leaders held an emergency summit, Greece focused on restoring funding to banking sector

Eurozone finance ministers ended with optimistic views but no concrete proposal
$$$$
Greece ready to submit request for financial assistance through the European Stability Mechanism
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
European leaders restarted negotiations in an emergency summit to discuss Greece’s future. The Greek delegation’s primary concern was the liquidity crisis in the banking sector following the ECB’s moves to cap its ELA access and further re-adjusted collateral on the emergency liquidity funds. Donald Tusk, who is currently heading the summit, wanted the leaders to make a decision on whether a long-term bailout deal is possible. 
$$$$
Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, left the summit in high spirits and was confident Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, will produce a “credible, good plan”. Austrian finance minister Hans-Joerg Schelling remarked the possibility of a Greek exit is “rather unlikely”. 
$$$$
Ahead of the European Union leaders’ emergency summit Wednesday, today’s finance ministers gathering was expected to start the technical groundwork. The new negotiations began today following the “no” vote in the July 5th referendum. Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijesselbloem released a statement shortly after the meeting. The meeting concluded with an understanding Greece would submit a request for support - which it later confirmed it would to the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). However, the Greek government opined, “July aid doesn’t have to come from ESM”.
$$$$
Tomorrow, the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank, and Eurozone (collectively known as The Institutions) will assess the financial situation in Greece primarily measuring finances and debt sustainability. The Institutions will formally begin negotiations shortly after. 
$$$$
Many Eurozone officials expected fresh proposals ahead of today’s finance ministers meeting but newly inducted Greek finance minister, Euclid Tskalotos, held off from just that. Instead, discussions were general and Greek delegates presented ideas. Belgian finance minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, said there was no concrete proposal but Tskalotos outlined ideas in a “good presentation”. 
$$$$
Greece needs to strike a deal before an ECB bond repayment due July 20 or it could go into arrears to a group which may cause more significant legal issues. The Greek banking sector, which has stayed afloat through ELA from the ECB, needs another cash infusion in the coming days. With critical talks and likely a number of meetings ahead, Sunday’s summit will be ‘decisive’ according to Matteo Renzi. Taking a more hardline view of the situation, European Council President Tusk offered similar evaluation of the time frame by saying the “final deadline ends this week.”

Greece awaits bridge loan, financing to repay IMF loan, make ECB payment on time

Talking Points:

After six months of back and forth negotiations, a missed International Monetary Fund payment, and increased volatility in European markets; Greece and its Eurozone made a breakthrough after a 17-hour meeting. The result of the tough meeting is a potential three-year, &euro;86 Billion bailout. A Syriza source said the party expected dissenting votes during parliament as the required austerity measures were harsh. However, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras claims he received debt relief and short-term financing options, which satisfied his requirements for his financially troubled economy.
$$$$
As of Monday morning, the European Central Bank kept its emergency credit line unchanged for another day – to reconsider the support after further progress is made on the technical side of the discussions such as Greece’s Parliamentary approval of the conditions agreed upon. Athens subsequently extended their two-week bank holiday through Sunday and continued capital controls. The current cap on ELA funding is €88.6 Billion. 
$$$$
As of this afternoon Eurozone finance ministers completed a meeting with group President Jeroen Dijsselbloem on bridge financing for Greece. The discussions were preliminary in nature according to Dijsselbloem, and a timetable was set for future meetings. He added, “It is very complex”, but technical experts will probe prospective options. 
$$$$
After completing the longest meeting in European Union history, EC President Donald Tusk announced the summit produced a “Unanimously reached agreement”. The spotlight now shifts to Athens, where Tsipras must generate support for what many assess as increased austerity with pension cuts and retirement reforms in order to receive the aid package from the Eurozone. Greek parliament has a strict Wednesday deadline to pass the reforms for bailout discussions to begin. Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, will vote on the proposed reforms on Friday, July 17th. The third bailout will include primary funding from the 28 EU states as well as IMF involvement - once Greece removes itself from arrears. 
$$$$
The EURUSD pair experienced a pronounced decline following yet another bearish weekend gap. The pair traded at $1.1953 at 6:45GMT this morning. Since then the Euro has depreciated against the dollar trading at $1.1004 at the time of writing. The decline seems to contradict the optimism of Euro-area stability implied from the compromise.

Bleak IMF report shows Eurozone has imposed less debt relief than requirements dictate 
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
After Greece agreed to terms on a third bailout with the European Union at Sunday’s 17-hour meeting, the country was required to seek approval from Athens. As of this afternoon, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has submitted the final version of Greece’s imposed pension and tax reforms to parliament. A vote is expected late Wednesday – a ‘Yes’ vote will substantially increase Greece’s chances to pay an upcoming European Central Bank loan as well as a missed International Monetary Fund payment. 
$$$$
Alexis Tsipras shed light on the Euro summit Sunday claiming Greece had two options; to accept the deal or exit the Eurozone. He added pensions and wages would not be cut, but reformed, and believed “It had to be done” even if not demanded. The accepted deal has debt restructuring after 2022 and covers Greece’s mid-term fiscal needs. Tsipras said the fragile Greek banking sector will give €25 Billion Euros to an asset sales fund in the next 30 days to avoid a bail-in. The banking sector will be restored gradually according to Tsipras, and capital controls will be lifted progressively. He concluded by asserting, the final agreement will be ratified in one month.
$$$$
Eurozone finance ministers are looking for options on a bridge loan, which was part of the agreement, for Greece. The ministers met again early Tuesday with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble voicing hard days ahead with remarks: “finding a temporary financing solution for Greece will be tough; this is what will occupy out attention over the next few days.” European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said European Financing Stabilisation Mechanism is an option for Greece’s bridge loan. However, many EU leaders insist EFSM is not a viable fund for Greek bridge financing. 
$$$$
Adding a troubling facet to the situation, an IMF report conveyed the terms that were set forth by the Eurozone fall short of Greece’s need for “massively more debt relief”. Eurozone countries are attempting to “reprofile” Greek debt to push back repayment dates and cut interest rates on loans. The IMF says debt-to-GDP will peak at 200% over the next two years. The IMF report is significant, as it cannot lend to a country if it doesn’t believe it is sustainable – the fund was willing to be involved in the third bailout once Greece removes itself from arrears. 
$$$$
After EURUSD experienced a pronounced decline yesterday morning, it moved back above its 20-day simple moving average. EURUSD traded at $1.1007 at the time of writing, and is generally conforming to an increasingly mature range as market participants await a clear view of the Euro’s fundamental backdrop.

IBM, Google and Others Take an FX Revenue Hit in Q1	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/04/25/IBM-Google-and-Others-Take-an-FX-Revenue-Hit-in-Q1.html	1429913820	"
Starting revenue is $6.1 Billion. 
$$$$
At our average EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.1278, this would equate to €5.4 Billionof revenue.
$$$$
This same €5.4 Billion converted at our beginning exchange rate of 1.2098 would equate to $6.54 Billion in revenue. 
"	"
IBM, Google and Others Take an FX Revenue Hit in Q1
$$$$
A strengthening dollar can have a harsh negative impact on US based corporations if they have subsidiaries abroad. The exchange rate risk is realized when a firm earns its revenue in a foreign country over a fiscal year and then needs to convert its proceeds into USD at a worse rate. The financing costs of operating the foreign operations are generally in USD - so while revenues fall, costs may remain constant.
$$$$
Consider an example from the current quarter. IBM reported revenues of $6.1 Billion in Europe/Africa in Q1 2015. This dollar amount is post-conversion. The EURUSD fell from 1.2098 at the beginning of the year to 1.0461. Under GAAP regulations revenue from overseas operations is recorded at the average rate, which would be 1.1280 in this case. This means that for each Euro in revenue the firm earned over 7 cents less than they had before the EUR move. The calculations to see what kind of impact this FX movement would have had on earnings can be seen below. 
$$$$
This firm saw their revenues from this region fall over $440,000,000, or 7.3%, while keeping all operating activities fixed. This firm reported a net profit margin of 14.8%, meaning for every billion dollars in revenues the firm saw a profit of $148,000,000. Using this margin we can see that the firm would have had an approximate increase in net income over $65,000,000 were it not for this movement in the exchange rate. 
$$$$
Without this FX movement the EPS would have been approximately $3.12, instead of the reported $2.91. Considering this projection in a vacuum, 21 cents may not seem like a drastic move but a 21 cent difference in EPS can be the difference between beating or missing EPS expectations. 
$$$$
Theoretically, these firms can attempt to hedge their FX exposure in the derivatives market, but this hedge generally will be insufficient for two reasons. The first is that firms cannot hedge their entire exposure unless they can forecast their exact amount of sales. The second weakness is that gains or losses from hedging instruments do not impact net income due to GAAP rules, so they will not hedge the firm’s risk of a falling EPS. With the recent earnings announcements several companies saw a noticeable difference in their earnings because of the recent appreciation in the United States Dollar. The approximate impact of the FX volatility can be seen in the table below:

When considering the negative impact that FX movements can have on EPS it is important to understand that this risk is systematic, not idiosyncratic. If the EUR/USD falls, any US based firm which has operations overseas is going to be impacted in a similar fashion. The level of impact is going to be determined by two things, the movement in foreign exchange rates and the amount of revenue which comes from overseas.

EURUSD hovered between the 1.1500 and 1.1200 figures between late January through the end of February as Greece weighed on traders’ minds. Consequently, the average directional index remained below zero during this period indicating an absence of a clear trend. During such periods of consolidation, it can be handy for traders to use the DailyFX Support & Resistance Wizard app to identify levels where price can be expected to bounce or eventually break to transition to a new trend. This resource can also help traders by providing reference points to place stops and limits.
$$$$
Referring back to EURUSD, the pair broke below Support levels established by the DailyFX Support & Resistance Wizard app despite Greece winning an extension of its bailout program last week. Since then, it has further declined to an eleven-and-a-half year low as the ECB is proceeded with a monthly &euro;60 billion per month stimulus program on March 9th. And, to follow up, US labor data rallied the Dollar on Friday. The US economy added 295K jobs in February versus 235K expected, and the unemployment rate fell to a new 6-1/2 year low 5.5%. This data will likely test the Fed’s time frame for raising interest rates.

EURUSD Running Out of Steam On the Hint of Negative Divergence	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2015/04/18/EURUSD-Running-Out-of-Steam-On-the-Hint-of-Negative-Divergence.html	1429329240	"

Talking Points:
$$$$
Since 2005 it has been a rare event for the EURUSD to rally or tumble for more than 6 consecutive weeks. When the pair began its dramatic 34% plunge almost one year ago, it experienced its first 8 consecutive week tumble for the first time since the Euro officially began trading. Since that record breaking move though, the bouts of selling have proven less persistent. This has in turn created what is referred to as a ‘negative divergence’. As the EURUSD continued its decline, the bearish performance has unfolded in smaller and smaller waves. We can identify these movements using the DailyFX Consecutive Bars Indicator. This app allows traders to see consecutive periods of gains or declines. 
$$$$
A divergence in the consistency of the EURUSD’s declines does not necessarily indicate that a reversal is at hand (this is a weekly chart, so timing needs to account for the periodicity at the very least). Given the proper fundamentals and speculative appetite, the pair can continue its decline; but its progress may likely be more measured and present a risk of more readily reversing should conditions shift. 
$$$$
Looking at 1Q 2015 forecasts for the Euro and US Dollar produced by the DailyFX Analysts, the Fed’s hawkish shift in tone alongside ECB’s stimulus measures will create pressure to push EURUSD downward. The European Central Bank introduced its 60 billion Euro per month stimulus on March 9, 2015. Greece’s financial situation still remains a looming issue that is affecting the Euro as well. Recently Dutch Financial Minister Dijsselbloem said it’s too soon to reassess Greek debt relief, though he trusts Greece’s financial minister Varoufakis. ECB’s Mario Draghi also commented that Euro-area outlook is brighter than it has been in the past several years and that recovery will broaden as well as strengthen. In contrast, the Fed’s Minutes from March 17-18 FOMC meeting showed that officials are divided on a June rate hike – though the majority still favors a hike in the foreseeable future. Changes in monetary policy – they are quick to state – are data dependent.  
$$$$
As bearish appetite dries up; the chance of a rebalancing grows. After the 7 consecutive week decline through 10/16/1999, EURUSD entered into a similar period of negative divergence. This ultimately resulted into a correction of roughly 14 percent before the pair eventually continued its downtrend. Though past performance is not indicative of future results, the DailyFX Consecutive Bars App can be used to find extreme movements and we can incorporate these considerations into our analysis.

Looking at the hourly chart of EURUSD we can see a triangle forming just under key trend-line resistance levels. A breakout above 11425 will put price above the high of the triangle as well as both trend-lines. Given the puke/capitulation like price action following the 1/22 ECB meeting, I still favor long set-ups unless the recent consolidation fails to hold (Line in sand = 12600).

"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
The Eurozone’s December CPI Estimate (YoY) revealed to have declined by 0.2%, marginally worse than the anticipated decrease of 0.1% and down from the prior year’s meagre growth of 0.3%. On the other hand, December’s Core CPI (YoY), a reading which exclude food and energy prices, paint a slightly more positive picture for the Eurozone economies. Taking into account of the persistent decline of oil prices in the past half year, the Eurozone’s underlying inflation level may have improved ever so slightly, as core CPI increased from an expected 0.7% to actual reading of 0.8%. Action on the EUR/USD pair remained subdued following the release, with the price of Euro hovering at levels just above the 9-year low breached earlier today at 1.1842 to the Greenback.
$$$$
Earlier today saw the release of upbeat December German Unemployment figures, with unemployment count of the largest Eurozone economy declining by 27000 within the month compared to the mere 5000 expected. The rosy labour market performance of Germany could not help lift negativity from the Euro as the market is anxious of various risk factors that could shake the Eurozone economies. This include the impending Greek snap election that could lead to its exit from the Eurozone plus the abandonment of the single currency, as well a wider implication on the structure of the ECB’s debt purchase program. In addition, the unrelenting decline in oil prices has been flowing through to the broader consumer price index and adding further deflationary pressure on prices in the Eurozone countries. The ECB will have a tough decision to make at its meeting on January 22 regarding plans of its Quantitative Easing programme, and traders should be wary of the additional volatility that will ensue in the upcoming days. Closer at hand is the release of US December FOMC meeting minutes at 19:00 GMT, which may offer clues from the US Federal Reserve on whether worries of Global economic deterioration will change up expectations for the US rate hike in the near future.
$$$$
Looking ahead, as EUR/USD has been treading on historic lows of almost a decade, any catalyst such as indications of a delay to ECB’s QE plans would likely induce a short term bounce for the pair. Likewise, possible signs of US Dollar weakness will also lift the pair up, as short positions will be eager to take some profit whilst traders waiting on the sidelines gauge for a timely re-entry. According to the DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index, the ratio of long to short positions in the EUR/USD currently stands at 1.60 as 61% of FXCM retail traders are long.

"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
In the past couple of weeks three of the four components in the equally weighted USDOLLAR Index have had significant technical events which lend support to the notion that USD could be on the cusp of entering the deepest decline since the October correction. Recently, EURUSD and AUDUSD bulls capitulated after fundamental events which ‘should’ have sent them much lower. When a currency doesn’t do as it ‘should’, it’s a warning that a reversal in trend and sentiment could be under way – It’s the stuff tops and bottoms are made of, even if only in the near-term. GBPUSD broke out of an ‘Inverted Head-and-shoulders’ pattern at major long-term support. The fourth constituent, USDJPY, has been living in a bubble; it’s been more closely levered to stocks than the FX market, and thus rangebound.
$$$$
With the USDOLLAR Index hanging precariously in the technical balance (rejection at 2009 high, testing up-trend support), U.S. NFP data tomorrow (1330 GMT) could be the fundamental event which triggers a major technical event; a break of a multi-month trend-line. A mantra I have learned to follow over the years is this – 'Trend-lines are to be trusted until broken', and with that said, I’ll be waiting for a confirmed break before becoming full-on bearish.

A poll conducted by the Rass polling agency shows that the Syriza party is leading the ruling New Democracy party by 3.1 percentage points. The snap election on January 25 comes after the government failed to elect the new head of state. The Syriza party has said it wants to roll back some of the austerity measures imposed by the IMF and the EU as part of Greece’s bailout agreement. The markets are concerned that a Syriza victory will fuel renewed Greek sovereign debt problems which may – in the worst case scenario – lead to the country’s exit from the Eurozone.

The deployment of the European Central Bank (ECB) Chief’s targeted lending program, often referred to as TLTRO, announced in June, showed a weak response as banks took €82.6 Billion in targeted long-term loans. A survey of economists polled by Bloomberg called for a median forecast of &euro;150 billion. The trillion euro stimulus package introduced by Mario Draghi, a tool to boost credit for the real economy and keep the financial system flooded with liquidity, is expected to boost ECB’s balance sheet to approximately 3-trillion euros from 2-trillion euros. The size of ECB’s balance sheet is negatively correlated with the Euro. 
$$$$
Ahead of the results of the first TLTRO stimulus, the Euro grinded higher against the US Dollar, but traded just shy of 1.2900 level. Immediately after the release, EUR/USD plunged to trim its earlier losses as ECB targeted loans came in weaker-than-forecast, trading firmly below the psychologically important 1.2900 level. DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak mentioned “a larger-than-expected capital allocation seems likely to offer support to the Euro.” However, the opposite has happened and it boded-ill for the currency pair.

Not too distant away, the market may possibly be free from the extensive risk built-up from the Scottish Independence Referendumas it draws to a close. The opinion polls ahead of the ballot points to a 50/50 chance of “Yes” or “No” outcome, which suggests volatility will remain alive for the session ahead in the forex market. 
$$$$
From a technical angle, DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak mentions near-term support to rest at 1.2858 (marked by the September 9 low) and support-turned-resistance at 1.2994 (September 16 high). He remains short EUR/USD in line with the long-term fundamental outlook. Meanwhile according to DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index, the ratio of long to short positions in EUR/USD stands at 1.15 as 53 percent of traders are long.

According to Markit, the Eurozone Manufacturing PMI in September came in at 50.5 compared to 50.7 in the prior month. It is the slowest expansion in 13-months and missed market expectations of 50.6. Moreover, Eurozone Services PMI accelerated at 52.8 for September versus 53.1 in August. It also missed market forecasts calling for a print of 53.0. A reading above 50.0 represents an expansion of the manufacturing sector and below 50.0 indicates a contraction. 
$$$$
Ahead of the PMI data, the Euro held steady against the US Dollar at around the 1.2850 level. Soon after the release, EUR/USD was relatively muted and continued to trade firmly below the psychologically important 1.2900 level. 
$$$$
Progressing ahead, September’s US Manufacturing PMI will be in focus as it crosses the wires at 13:45 GMT later today. The market is expecting the US manufacturing industry to have accelerated at 58.0 in September, which is slightly higher from an acceleration of 57.9 in August. Any print that exceeds market forecasts will add fuel to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has been up for the last 10-weeks and this momentum may continue as US data strengthens.

The German IFO Business Climate Index came in at 104.7 in September versus 106.3 in August. It is the lowest reading since April 2013 and came short of market expectations of 105.8. Moreover, German IFO Expectations Index showed a print of 99.3 from 101.7 in the previous month. This is the lowest reading since December 2012 and exceedingly missed market forecasts calling for 101.2. Meanwhile, slight improvement in August German IFO Current Assessment Index as it crossed the wires at 110.5 from the consensus of 110.2. The country’s key business sentiment surveys uses 100 as a centerline between positive and negative outlooks. The further north the value is from 100 the stronger the sentiment and vice versa. Number above 100.0 bodes-well for the economy as it may indicate increased consumer spending and economic growth.
$$$$
It was a very quiet trading session ahead of the data and the Euro continued to trade firmly below 1.2900 level against the US Dollar. Following the release, EUR/USD fell 15 pips lower to trade as low as 1.2849. In addition, German 10-year Government bond advanced with yield dropping 2 basis-points to 0.99 percent.

Looking ahead, US Durable Goods Orders in August is probably the most attention seeking economic release for the remainder of the week. It is expected to cross the wires on Thursday 25th of September at 12:30 GMT. The data displays the value of orders placed for relatively long lasting goods, usually more than three-years, and is a favorable gauge for future US output. It is expected to come in at -18.0 percent in August in comparison to 22.6 percent in July. The prior month’s reading was primarily driven by a surge of orders for civilian aircraft and, therefore, US Durables Ex Transportation would be the more closely watched indicator. This is expected to drop in at 0.60 percent for the month of August.

$$$$
The August Eurozone Retail PMI came in at 45.8 compared to the prior month’s reading of 47.6. It was the lowest reading in 15-months and missed market expectations calling for 47.6. The Euro remained relatively muted against the US Dollar as traders may see this economic data as less significant in the upcoming monetary policy decision. EUR/USD remained firmly below the critical 1.3200 level.
$$$$
Being watchful ahead, the much anticipated September European Central Bank (ECB) Rate Decision followed by ECB’s Chief Mario Draghi Press Conference will take center stage at 11:45 and 12:30 GMT respectively. Market seems to be prepared for an expansion of stimulus subsequent to the dovish rhetoric made by Mario Draghi at the Jackson Hole Symposium last month. On that note, DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak suggest for a possible disappointment, which would come against a backdrop of heavily skewed anti-Euro positioning.
$$$$
Taking technical analysis into consideration, Ilya Spivak mentions near-term support to rest at 1.3104 (September 2013 low) and near-term resistance at 1.3151 (76.4% Fib Expansion). He is short EUR/USD at 1.3644 in line with his long-term fundamental outlook.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi spoke in Vilnius, Lithuania at 07:00 GMT today. There were nothing new mentioned from his speech but he reiterated ECB’s commitment in their mandate of price stability. Moreover, he alluded to the geopolitical concerns and the lower Euro to provide stability from these risks. This is on the backdrop of the ECB President addressing to the economic and monetary affairs committee of the European parliament on Monday, where he mentioned and reiterated ECB’s readiness in using additional unconventional monetary tools if needed. In addition, he expects more demand for the TLTROs from the banks, when the funding is up for grabs again in December. 
$$$$
Before ECB Mario Draghi’s speech, the Euro hit a 14-month low against the US Dollar in Asian trade on Thursday. Following the speech, EUR/USD extended losses to trade firmly below 1.2800 and traded as low as 1.2732 level. The driving force was also from the broad US Dollar strength that managed to climb to a 4-year high. From a technical standpoint, DailyFX Currency Analyst David De Ferranti mentions a breach of the 1.2755 floor, which would open up towards the November 2012 low near 1.2660 and resistance at 1.2850. Meanwhile according to DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index, the ratio of long to short positions in the EUR/USD stands at 1.68 as 63 percent of traders are long.

$$$$
The German Trade Balance for the month of August recorded a surplus 14.1 billion euros compared to the prior month’s surplus of 23.5 billion euros. The amount of surplus fell short of market expectations, which called for a surplus of 17.7 billion euros in August. The German trade balance figures are an important gauge into pressures on the value of the Euro as its one of the biggest components of their Balance of Payments. Germany is Euro-region’s largest economy and given Germany’s an export oriented economy, trade figures can give critical insight into their currency flows. Trade surplus fundamentally reflects that the Euro is flowing into the country and vice versa.
$$$$
After the release of the figures, EUR/USD remained relatively muted as it may not have had much drive in influencing monetary policy decisions. Ahead of the data, the Euro traded higher against the US Dollar to trade firmly above 1.2700 level. This is on the backdrop of a selloff in the US Dollar after the release of the FOMC Minutes, earlier today. The minutes revealed concerns by the FOMC Committee of the growth outlook in the global economy as well as pointing to the recent surge in the US Dollar to have an adverse impact on the domestic economy. Newswires suggest the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks greenback against 10 major currencies, is up almost 6 percent since the start of July. This also translates into a twelve consecutive week rally from the US Dollar. 
$$$$
From a technical panorama, DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak mentions near-term support to rest at 1.2703 (November 2012 floor) and support-turned-resistance at 1.2777 (March 2013 bottom). He is short EUR/USD and waits to close out the rest of the position.

$$$$
The German Unemployment Change for the month of August came in at 2,000 versus 12,000 in July (revised higher). This missed market expectations calling for a fall in unemployment by 5,000. Despite an increase in unemployment, August German Unemployment Rate came in at 6.7 percent. This was consistent with five consecutive months and met with market forecasts of 6.7 percent. The aforementioned data is important and should be taken into consideration by forex traders as further deterioration in unemployment may keep the European Central Bank (ECB)on the sidelines throughout the remainder of 2014 says DailyFX Currency Analyst David Song.
$$$$
Ahead of the data, EUR/USD managed to push above the critical 1.3200 level to trade at 1.3203. Immediately after the release, the Euro took a dive but remained relatively muted against the US Dollar amid breaking below the psychologically important 1.3200 mark. 
$$$$
Focusing ahead, EUR/USD will be fed by the release of August’s German Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and the revised second-quarter US GDP report, which is due at 12:00 GMT and 12:30 GMT respectively, later today. The 2Q US GDP report is expected, by the market, to be revised down to 3.9 percent from an initial reading of 4.0 percent. DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak says softer-than-expected print may undermine the speculation of a sooner-than-later interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, which bodes-ill for the US Dollar. Finally, Eurozone CPI numbers are set to take center stage on Friday and its outcome may provide traders with more information of the timing and the possibility for further easing by the ECB. 
$$$$
For those forex traders that endorse technical analysis when trading, Ilya Spivak mentions near-term support to rest at 1.3151 (76.4% Fib Ret.) and near-term resistance at 1.3232 (14.6% Fib Ret.). He is short EUR/USD at 1.3644 in line with his long-term fundamental outlook.

The Euro area Current Account surplus, seasonally adjusted, grew to €19.5B in May, European Central Bank data showed today. The data that summarizes the flow of goods, services, income and transfer payments in and out of the Eurozone nations to other countries, slowed from €21.6B in April. On an unadjusted basis, the Eurozone Current Account surplus totaled €8.9B versus €18.8B in the prior month. 
$$$$
Ahead of the data, the Euro gained against the Greenback to trade as high as 1.3532. But after the release, EUR/USD remained uneventful. This limited reaction may be due to traders being more focused on the global headlines that increased volatility earlier in the session. DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak says “volatility may be on tap all the same however as geopolitical jitters rattle financial markets”.

From a technical standpoint, Ilya Spivak mentions near-term support rests at 1.3502-12 (28.2% Fib Exp.) and resistance at 1.3583-607 (23.6% Fib, trend line). He is currently short EUR/USD at 1.3644 in line with his long-term fundamental outlook.

$$$$
The preliminary Eurozone Manufacturing PMI came in at 51.9 for the month of July versus 51.8 print in the prior month. This reading was slightly above market expectations of 51.7 and showed an expansion for 13 consecutive months. A continued acceleration for the Eurozone’s manufacturing sector was again supported by Germany, the region’s powerhouse. Its manufacturing PMI registered at 52.9, which exceeded analysts’ forecast of 51.9. The PMIs are regarded as a reliable forward-looking indicators of the health of an economy. Importantly, both the manufacturing PMI reported held above the 50 mark which divides expansion from contraction. 
$$$$
Ahead of the data, the world’s most liquid currency pair, EUR/USD trimmed its earlier losses following a better-than-expected German PMI print to trade as high as 1.3474. Subsequent to the region-wide manufacturing PMI data release, the Euro remained relatively muted to trade near the session high of 1.3474. A further fall in the Euro may have been prevented as a positive PMI from the Eurozone slightly lifted the bets on a further expansion of ECB stimulus. But EUR/USD remains firmly below the key 1.3500 level. 
$$$$
Considering technical analysis, DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak mentions near-term support rests at 1.3454 (50% Fib Exp.) and resistance at 1.3502-12 (38.2% Fib Exp.). He remains short EUR/USD at 1.3644 in line with the long-term fundamental outlook. Meanwhile according to DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index, 56 percent of retail Forex traders are long EUR/USD.

$$$$
The US Dollar is broadly stronger this morning against its major peers in what is otherwise a quiet US trading session. The strength in the greenback may be due to firming Fed bets, and interest rate speculation, but all else equal, there does not seem to be a strong catalyst explaining the strength in the US Dollar.
$$$$
This morning the US economic calendar was complete with several data figures, but it was June’s US CPI data that headlined economic risk. The benchmark year-on-year inflation rate registered at 2.1 percent, unchanged from prior month. The core rate (excludes Food and Energy) missed analysts’ expectations of 2.0 percent, and reported at 1.9 percent. With this in mind, there is not much inspiration for speculation that the time gap between October’s end of Fed QE and the first subsequent interest rate hike will be shorter than expected.
$$$$
Later in the day the US House Price index reported at 0.4 percent, beating analysts’ expectations calling for a print of 0.2 percent. The outcome marks the highest level in two-months, and may fuel investor optimism that the US economy is recovering as the housing market is doing well.

The mixed US Data this morning was unable to inspire relief in the Euro. The single-currency bloc has been under pressure since market open on this week, and has been losing ground since ECB Draghi verbally intervened on May 8th, 2014. DailyFX Analyst Christopher Vecchio notes that it is important to be highly selective with USD-pair exposure. He says that EURUSD may be an interesting pair to express USD strength, particularly as it is breaking its July 2012-July 2013 uptrend.

German Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer items, increased by 1.0 percent year-on-year for the month of June. This print was faithful to market expectations of 1.0 percent and uniform to the prior month’s price-growth. On a month-to-month basis, the gauge for the strength of domestic inflationary pressures, also crossed the wires in line with economists’ forecasts of 0.3 percent. 
$$$$
Ahead of the data, EUR/USD ran out of gas as it slid below the psychologically significant 1.3600 level to trade as low as 1.3595. The pair’s drift lower may have reflected some anticipation of a weak CPI reading given the data had underperformed relative to consensus forecasts since July 2013 amid swelling stimulus expansion bets says DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak. But after the data release, the Euro trimmed losses against the US Dollar to break through the 1.3600 handle. 
$$$$
From a technical perspective, Ilya Spivak mentions near-term support rests at 1.3583 (23.6% Fib Exp.) and support-turned-resistance at 1.3668. He is currently short EUR/USD at 1.3644 in line with the long-term fundamental outlook.

The Eurozone Retail PMI, which tracks month-on-month changes in the value of retail sales, registered at 50.0 for the month of June. This was marginally higher than the prior reading of 49.9 in May. Germany remained the powerhouse in the Eurozone retail sector as its retail PMI came in at 56.2, accelerating from 52.5 in the prior month. Meanwhile, France and Italy acted to offset this healthiness as their retail PMI figures crossed the wires at 47.6 and 43.8 respectively. This is a reading below 50.0, which indicates a contraction. 
$$$$
Ahead of the data, EUR/USD lost ground breaking the psychologically important 1.3600 level to trade almost 20 pips lower. There has been a string of disappointing economic prints this week, from the region, amid the European Central Bank keeping its key policy rate at 0.15 percent as expected on Thursday. ECB Governor Mario Draghi announced no further stimulus at this point as the central bank assesses the impact of its recently revealed TLTRO program. Any further hints on future stimulus expansion would likely bode ill for the Euro says DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak.
$$$$
From a technical standpoint, near term support rests at 1.3500 and resistance at 1.3700 says DailyFX Currency Analyst David De Ferranti. Moreover, DailyFX Senior Currency Strategist Kristian Kerr has noted a move below 1.3590 will turn us negative on the exchange rate.

$$$$
German Industrial Production reflected a 1.3 percent rise year-on-year. This fell incredibly short of market expectations as industrial output for the Eurozone’s powerhouse was estimated to increase by 3.8 percent year-on-year for the month of May. This follows a prior reading of 1.3 percent (revised lower) for April. On a month-on-month basis, the gauge of industrial sector activity registered a print of negative 1.8 percent versus economists’ forecasts for a 0.0 percent increase. The April reading was also revised to negative 0.3 percent. 
$$$$
Ahead of the data, EUR/USD was drifting south, below 1.3600, with the data causing a dip to 1.3581 after the release. The downward momentum seems to persevere on the backdrop of a weaker Euro against the US Dollar last week. US labor market data revealed the US Unemployment Rate fell to a post-recession low of 6.1 percent and the strong US Non-Farm Payroll figures outpaced markets’ expectation says DailyFX Currency Analyst Christopher Vecchio. He further discusses the diverging monetary policy between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which will leave the Euro at a disadvantage against the US Dollar going forward. Any further hints on future stimulus expansion from the ECBwould likely bode ill for the Euro says DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak.
$$$$
From a technical standpoint, near term support rests at 1.3500 and resistance at 1.3590 says DailyFX Currency Analyst David de Ferranti. Moreover, DailyFX Senior Currency Strategist Kristian Kerr has noted a move below 1.3590 will turn us negative on the exchange rate.

EUR/USD Muted After Eurozone PMI, Focus Turns To ECB Policy Meeting	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2014/07/03/EURUSD-Muted-After-Eurozone-PMI-Focus-Turns-To-ECB-Policy-Meeting-.html	1404378180	"

Want to trade with proprietary strategies developed by FXCM? Find out how here.
$$$$
The Eurozone Services PMI, index for the Eurozone’s vast services industry, registered at 52.8 for the month of June. This was in line with economists’ forecasts, yet represented a drop from 53.2 in the prior month. Meanwhile, Eurozone Composite PMI, widely seen as a valuable gauge of economic growth, came in line with forecasts of 52.8. Similarly, this figure was a drop from 53.5 in the month of May. Importantly, both data points held above the 50 mark which divides expansion from contraction.  
$$$$
The release of the PMI figures had a relatively muted impact on EUR/USD which may reflect traders prioritizing the European Central Bank (ECB) Policy Meeting, due later today. DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak has said investors are braced for increased volatility with the ECB rate decision, which will be followed by ECB Governor Mario Draghi’s press conference that may provide hints on future stimulus expansion. In particular traders will likely be listening in for hints at the possibility of an ABS purchase program being introduced. Ilya further notes such an outcome is likely to bode ill for the Euro.
$$$$
From a technical standpoint, near term support rests at 1.3654 (23.6% Fib exp.) and resistance at 1.3689 -1.37 (38.2% Fib exp.) says DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak. He remains on the sidelines for now until more actionable confirmation of a reversal below a rising trend line presents itself.

Want to trade with proprietary strategies developed by FXCM? Find out how here.
$$$$
The German Unemployment Change data for the month of July came in at -12,000 versus the prior month print of 7,000. This is the biggest fall since April 2014, and exceeded market expectations of -5,000. Moreover, German Unemployment Rate registered at 6.7 percent for the month of July, which is a reading that has not changed for the last four months. 
$$$$
Ahead of the data, EUR/USD trimmed some of its losses from the earlier session to trade at 1.3392. After the release, the Euro managed to recoup all of its earlier losses against the US Dollar, but failed to break the psychologically significant 1.3400 level. This was on the backdrop of a better-than-expected reading in June’s Italy Unemployment Rate, which crossed the wires at 12.3 percent versus 12.6 percent in the prior month.
$$$$
Looking ahead, the July’s Eurozone CPI is due at 09:00 GMT, today. The market is calling for a reading of 0.5 percent year-on-year. DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak mentions any downside surprise in the Eurozone’s price-growth figure will feed ECB stimulus expansion bets, weighing on the Euro. Furthermore, the focus will be back on the US Dollar as the much anticipated July Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) figure and the US Unemployment Rate are due on Friday, 12:30 GMT. The consensus is an addition of 231,000 jobs for the July’s NFP and the unemployment rate to equal the prior month’s reading of 6.1 percent. Any upside surprise in the job figures could generate further gains for the greenback says DailyFX Currency Analyst David De Ferranti.
$$$$
For those deliberating on technical analysis, Ilya Spivak has designated near-term support to rest at 1.3396 (61.8% Fibonacci Exp.) and resistance at 1.3454 (50% Fibonacci Exp.). He remains short EUR/USD on half of the original position and in line with the long-term fundamental outlook. Meanwhile according to DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index, 60 percent of retail Forex traders are long the EUR/USD.

EUR/USD Hits A Fresh Session Low As Germany 2Q GDP Misses Estimates.

Want to trade with proprietary strategies developed by FXCM? Find out how here.
$$$$
The German Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second-quarter contracted 0.2 percent and missed estimates that called for a 0.1 percent contraction. This is compared to a print of 0.8 percent expansion from the first-quarter. Moreover, the lagging indicator showed a year-on-year GDP at 1.2 percent versus 2.3 percent year-on-year reading in the first-quarter. It missed market expectations of 1.4 percent. The region’s powerhouse failed to do the heavy lifting and such an outcome may boost ECB stimulus expansion bets, weighing the Euro says DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak. 
$$$$
Before the data, EUR/USD fell mildly on the backdrop of a report that showed the second largest economy in the Eurozone, French economic growth, unchanged for the second-quarter. It missed market forecast of 0.1 percent and the currency pair continued to trade firmly below the critical 1.3400 level. Immediately after the release of the German GDP figures, the Euro plunged against the US Dollar to hit a fresh session low of 1.3350. 
$$$$
Looking ahead, the Eurozone GDP and CPI figures will take center stage at 09:00 GMT, today. Traders will be watching closely at the Eurozone GDP figures as it’s the most comprehensive measure of economic output and provides key insight to the overall economy. DailyFX Chief Currency Strategist John Kicklighter mentions the possibility of a lift in the Eurozone yields if growth starts to waver due to capital flight out of the region, which will bode ill for the Euro. See John’s Trading Video explaining how the GDP release can impact the Euro.
$$$$
For the forex traders that respect technical analysis, Ilya Spivak mentions near-term support at 1.3345 (23.6% Fib Exp.) and near-term resistance at 1.3419 (23.6% Fib Ret.). He is short EUR/USD in line with the long-term fundamental outlook and says an upswing will be treated as an opportunity to add to the position. Meanwhile according to DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index, the ratio of long to short positions in the EUR/USD stands at 1.59 as 61% of traders are long.

$$$$
The August German IFO Business Climate index crossed the wires at 106.3 compared to 108.0 in the previous month. It missed market expectations of 107.0, which is the lowest reading in 13-months. The August German IFO Current Assessment index came in at 111.1 versus 112.9 in July and missed estimates of 112.0. Moreover, German IFO Expectations dropped in weaker-than-forecast at 101.7. It seems the Euro-region’s powerhouse, responsible for approximately a quarter of the total Eurozone’s GDP, has deteriorated in last couple of months followed by the recent contraction for the 2Q. The country’s key business sentiment surveys use 100 as a centerline between positive and negative outlooks. The further north the value is from 100 the stronger the sentiment and vice versa. 
$$$$
Ahead of the data, EUR/USD continued to grind lower on the backdrop of broad US Dollar outperformance in response to supportive comments from Federal Chairwoman Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium last week. It traded firmly below the psychologically significant 1.3200 level. Immediately after the release of the figures, the Euro remained relatively muted against the US Dollar to remain firmly below the critical 1.3200 level. This worst-than-expected prints from Germany seems to add to the speculation about an expansion of ECB stimulus efforts, after dovish comments from the Chief Mario Draghi, says DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak.
$$$$
Looking ahead, the focus will turn to the US Dollar as July’s New Homes Sales figures are due at 14:00 GMT, later today. US economic news-flow has improved since early April and DailyFX Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak says there are rooms for an upside surprise from USD as analysts are underestimating the strength of the US economy. 
$$$$
Taking technical analysis into consideration, Ilya Spivak mentions near-term support at 1.3248 (50% Fib Exp.) and resistance at 1.3190-204 (61.8% Fib Exp.). He is short EUR/USD at 1.3644 in line with his long-term fundamental outlook. Meanwhile according to DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index, the ratio of long to short positions in the EUR/USD stands at 2.05 as 67 percent of traders are long.

Yen Gains on CPI Data, Aussie and NZ Dollars in Correction Mode	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2014/05/30/Forex-Yen-Gains-on-CPI-Data-Aussie-and-NZ-Dollars-in-Correction-Mode.html	1401427560	"

$$$$
Japanese Yen Rallies as CPI Data Dents BOJ Stimulus Bets, Sinks Nikkei 225
$$$$
US Dollar May Renew Advance on Personal Income & Spending, UofM Data
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
The New Zealand Dollar outperformed in overnight trade, rebounding after sliding to a three-month low against its US namesake yesterday. We see the bounce as corrective and remain short NZDUSD. The Australian Dollar likewise moved higher, continuing to build on yesterday’s recovery. Here too, near-term upside momentum seems to be playing out in the context of a larger move downward and we continue to hold short AUDUSD. 
$$$$
The Japanese Yen rallied after April’s CPI report put the headline year-on-year inflation rate at 3.4 percent, the highest since 1991, eroding the likelihood of a near-term expansion of BOJ stimulus efforts. Added support was found in risk sentiment trends as fading monetary stimulus hopes weighed on the Japan’s Nikkei 225 benchmark stock index, feeding demand for the safe-linked currency.
$$$$
A quiet economic calendar in European hours is likely to see traders looking ahead to the US data docket, where the spotlight will on April’s Personal Income and Spending figures as well as the final revision of May’s University of Michigan Consumer Confidence gauge. The trend in US economic data outcomes has looked increasingly supportive relative to expectations since early April, opening the door for upside surprises. Rosy news-flow is likely to bolster investors’ Fed policy outlook, driving the US Dollar higher.

EUR/USD Ignores German and French CPI, ECB June Meeting in Focus	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2014/05/14/EURUSD-Ignores-German-and-French-CPI-ECB-June-Meeting-in-Focus.html	1400050980	"

$$$$
French CPI Reported Worse than Expected
$$$$
Eurozone CPI Due Later this Week
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
The release of the final revision of April’s German CPI reading proved uneventful, with the benchmark year-on-year inflation rate confirmed at 1.3 percent and the month-on-month change matching initial estimates to show a -0.2 percent decline. 
$$$$
On the other hand, French CPI reported worse than expected with the headline year-on-year inflation rate at 0.7 percent, missing estimates calling for a print of 0.9 percent. The month-on-month change also missed estimates reporting at 0.0 percent vs 0.1 percent expected. 
$$$$
The Euro was little-changed to the inflation reports and managed to hold onto overnight gains. The move may reflect profit-taking after the ECB announced the possibility of intervention in June sending the EUR/USD from a year-to-date high of 1.3995 to a May low of 1.36902.

EUR/USD Firm Despite Mixed Eurozone PMI Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2014/05/22/EURUSD-Firm-Despite-Mixed-Eurozone-PMI-Data.html	1400751000	"
Losses seen in EUR/USDafter disappointing French PMIs.
$$$$
EUR/USD trims losses as German PMIs are released.
$$$$
Eurozone PMI seems to be mixed but signals continued growth.
"	"
Talking Points:
$$$$
The release of the May French PMIscaused EUR/USD to shed 16 pips to trade at 1.3662 from 1.3673, ahead of the data. Both, manufacturing and services PMI in France fell short of expectations coming in at 49.3 vs 51.0 and 49.2 vs 50.2. A reading, which may have raised concerns over the outlook for the Eurozone’s second largest economy given a reading below 50 signals contraction. 
$$$$
Shortly after the French PMI figures the German manufacturing figures were released, which came in at 52.9, falling to a 6-month low. Meanwhile, the services industry in the Eurozone’s largest economy rose to a 35 month high of 56.4 from 54.7. Overall, a reading above 50.0 on the index signals expansion.  
$$$$
Finally, 30 minutes later the release of the Eurozone’s PMI data left EUR/USD little-changed. The figures were mixed with the Eurozone’s manufacturing and services PMI coming in at 52.5 vs 53.2 and 53.5 vs 53.0 respectively. Additionally, the Composite Index, which is seen as a key gauge for economic growth, came in at 53.9 matching economists’ expectations.

EUR/USD Plunges to 3-Month Low on Dismal German IFO Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2014/05/23/EURUSD-Plunges-to-3-Month-Low-on-Dismal-German-IFO-Data.html	1400834220	"

The Euro sank to a 3-month low on the back of disappointing German IFO figures that may further boost speculation for ECB stimulus.
$$$$
The German IFO gauge of business confidence disappointed across the board as the headline business climate index fell to 110.4 (110.9 estimates vs 111.2 prior), the lowest level in 5-months. Despite the miss, the print falls broadly in line with near- to medium-term trend averages. The gauge for current business confidence came in at 114.8 (115.4 expected vs 115.3 prior) and future expectations also fell to 106.2 (106.5 expected vs 107.3 prior). 
$$$$
“On balance, these figures offer little in terms of directional guidance for the Euro in as much they would do little further to inform speculation about the likelihood of imminent ECB stimulus expansion,” says DailyFX Strategist Ilya Spivak. At present, he has entered short EUR/USD. 
$$$$
The Euro has been under pressure since the ECB meeting on May 8th. The outlook remains bearish as euro economic data worsens amid rampant ECB speculation.  
$$$$
The Euro sank vs the US Dollar following the data release, to the lowest level since February 27, 2014. 
$$$$
“There is a lot to break through at these levels. The 200 day average, October high and 2/27 low continue to hold up,” says DailyFX Strategist Jamie Saettele, “but two reversal attempts since 5/15 have failed. As such, beware a flush into 1.3560/90.” He is currently looking at a EUR/USD diagonal wedge pattern, that if fully retraced yields a target of 1.3294.

The regional Eurozone Composite PMIconfirmed preliminary estimates showing manufacturing- and service-sector activity grew at the fastest pace in three years. However, the positive figures may not be enough to support the Euro or the case for a Eurozone recovery. “[The] upbeat cyclical cues may not have a lasting positive impact on the single currency however as anemic inflation readings continue to fuel ECB stimulus bets,” says DailyFX Strategist Ilya Spivak, “the proximity of this week’s policy announcement from ECB President Mario Draghi and company may further undermine conviction, hinting the standstill may for now continue.” The ECB is expected to maintain its cash rate at 0.25 percent and its lending rate unchanged at 0.75 percent.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development raised its expectations for 2015 growth in three of the four of the world’s biggest economies in the May release of its Economic Outlook. Even though the OECD cut its world growth forecast for 2014 to 3.4% from 3.6%, the organization maintained a 3.9% world GDP projection for 2015. 
$$$$
Ahead of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting, the OECD called on the ECB to take new policy actions to move inflation decisively towards its target and warned that inflation could turn into deflation. Although the OECD lowered its Chinese growth forecast for 2014 and 2015, it said that the new GDP rates are more economically sustainable. 
$$$$
The OECD encouraged the Fed to end quantitative easing by the end of 2014, as the OECD said that the US recovery should gain pace, lowering unemployment, reducing economic slack, and inflation rising close to target. 
$$$$
The OECD’s suggestion for the ECB to take new action could affect EUR/USD trading. If the ECB decides to adopt new monetary policy measures to prevent deflation, the Euro could decline in Forex markets.  
$$$$
However, Senior Technical Strategist Jamie Saettele warns that an ending diagonal is underway in Euro trading against the US Dollar, in which case the EUR/USD would most likely trade above 1.4000 before topping out. See Jamie’s chart below:

The preliminary set of May’s Eurozone CPI figures underlines the stubbornly low-inflationary environment that has gripped the Eurozone. The headline year-on-year inflation rate registered at 0.5 percent, missing expectations calling for a print of 0.6 percent, and down from 0.7 percent recorded in the previous month. 
$$$$
News-flow from the currency bloc has increasingly disappointed relative to market expectations in recent months, opening the door for downside surprise, and Eurozone unemployment surprised indeed, but on a positive note. The headline unemployment figure reported at 11.7 percent, beating analyst expectations calling for a print of 11.8 percent, and hitting a 4-month low. 
$$$$
The European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate decision on Thursday is followed by a policy announcement. Market participants will look to the actions by the ECB for a broader outlook on the single currency.

The European Central Bank (ECB) went beyond a standard refinancing rate cut, cutting its deposit rate to negative territory for the first time in history. DailyFX Currency Analyst says the negative deposit rate would impact around €100B; prompt enhanced forward guidance with promise for future action; and liquidity measures aimed at helping small- and medium-sized enterprises (similar to the Bank of England's FLS).

Eurozone PMI data came in better-than-expected as service-sector activity reached a 34-month high, and factory-sector activity rose to a 3-month high. Earlier in the European session, German and French PMI also topped analyst expectations. The improvement in PMI figures brings some relief as recent news-flow from the single currency has increasingingly underperformed relative to expectations; according to a Citigroup gauge measuring the gap between economists’ estimates and realized outcomes. 
$$$$
The Euro popped higher as the news crossed the wires, potentially reflecting easing bets on ECB stimulus. The ECB pleads for a weaker Euro, but appears adamant on holding back to quantitative easing.

German economic expectations worsened in March 2014 as the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment fell for the fourth consecutive month to 46.6 (52 consensus and 55.7 in February). Economic expectations for the Eurozone also lost ground as the indicator fell from 68.5 to 61.5 in March. 
$$$$
The survey weighed heavily on the euro, but the dip was short-lived. According to DailyFX Strategist Ilya Spivak, this is not surprising after yesterday’s downgrade of headline CPI – a far more direct indicator for monetary policy – failed to yield a meaningful response.

The Euro ignored the release of the final revision of February’s German CPI but climbed higher against the US Dollar as it recovered some losses from yesterday. The benchmark year-on-year inflation rate confirmed at 1.2 percent and is the lowest inflation print since October 2013. The month-on-month change matched initial estimates of 0.5 percent. 
$$$$
The German inflation data follows ominous comments made yesterday by ECB President Mario Draghi that sent the euro tumbling. He verbally intervened – that is common for central banks – saying that the current rate of exchange is a factor for the persisting low-inflation and noted that an exchange rate close to 2012 levels would be ideal. Following the comments, DailyFX Strategist Ilya Spivak notes that the Euro rally may finally turn-over on the back of a technical top that may be in place.

US economic data has played an important role for dollar traders since Fed Chair Yellen said in February that only a notable change in the economic outlook could prompt a slowdown of the taper pace. Last week, the change in US Non-Farm Payrolls beat expectations for February, signaling that the jobs recovery continued despite weather conditions.

European Central Bank President Draghi sounded caution today regarding recent Euro gains, leading to a 50 pip decline in EUR/USD. He said that Euro gains are increasingly relevant to price stability and added that the ECB will counter any material risk to inflation expectations. 
$$$$
Draghi also said that too-low inflation is now more relevant than too-high inflation, which was a change in language from Draghi’s comments earlier this month that inflation risks are broadly balanced. Draghi’s previous comments followed the ECB’s decision to keep the interest rate unchanged, but Draghi also warned then that ECB is ready to consider all available instruments if necessary. Therefore, any signs that the ECB is closer to reacting to lower price pressures may push the Euro lower.
$$$$
EUR/USD 1-Minute: March 13, 2014

That’s why the Euro declined more than 50 pips against the US Dollar on the release of Draghi’s comments. EUR/USD has fallen back 100 pips from the 2-year high set earlier today, and those looking for a continuation of bullish price action should consider waiting for a close above 1.3970, according to Senior Currency Strategist Kristian Kerr.

$$$$
The Euro fell about thirty pips against the US Dollar, as European Central Bank member Makuch said the bank is preparing measures to avoid a deflation environment. Following the near 5 cent gain in the value of the Euro in terms of US Dollars since the beginning of February, Makuch said that he sees potential for a weaker Euro. Additionally, Makuch said he would not oppose quantitative easing, which would be an unprecedented action for the ECB.
$$$$
Makuch’s comments reinforced Draghi’s statement earlier this month that Euro gains are increasing relevant to price stability and the ECB will counter any material risk to inflation expectations. Any further accommodative action from the ECB to fight low inflation could drive the Euro lower. 
$$$$
EUR/USD 1-Minute: March 25, 2014
$$$$
That’s why the Euro declined following Makuch’s dovish comments, and EUR/USD may next find support by the 2-week low at 1.3749. Currency Strategist Ilya Spivak says that a daily close below 1.3779 could lead him to look for selling opportunities.

Germany’s IFO survey of business confidence showed sentiment fell for the first time after a five-month consecutive rise. The headline Business Confidence gauge missed expectations calling for a print of 110.9, and reported at 110.7 in March (one month low). The Euro dipped on the worse-than-expected survey numbers, but quickly recovered to familiar overnight ranges. DailyFX Strategist Ilya Spivak says limited follow-through is a result of the outcome’s limited implications for near-term monetary policy. Moreover, Mario Draghi may decide to wait for the outcome of the Asset Quality Review (AQR) before making a policy move. Despite Euro’s resilience to a low-inflation environment traders may look to Friday’s preliminary set of Germany’s March Inflation data for further volatility.

The Euro rose (albeit marginally) against the US Dollar following the release of Germany’s GfK Consumer Confidence Survey. The forward-looking index reported at 8.5 in April and in-line with expectations. The index remained at the same level from March and is the highest level in seven-years. Considering the limited implications of the data point on ECB monetary policy the move may see limited follow-through. 
$$$$
Yesterday, the Euro fell against the US Dollar following comments made by European Central Bank Member Makuch. The Eurozone has been facing a low-inflation environment and ECB’s Makuch said that the central bank is preparing measures to combat low-inflation. These comments weigh heavier on the Euro as they relate to ECB’s primary objective in maintaining price stability. DailyFX Strategist Ilya Spivak maintains a long-term bearish outlook for the Euro, but remains cautious to taking on a short position as EUR/USD is at a critical channel floor. 
$$$$
Later today traders may be looking ahead to February’s US Durable Goods Orders. Expectations point to the largest increase in three months.

Euro at Risk for Further Losses on ECB Stimulus Expansion Bets

Talking Points:
$$$$
Preliminary sets of March German and Eurozone PMI figures were released earlier in the European session. German PMI data greatly disappointed as service-sector activity fell to a 2-month low, and factory-sector activity fell to a 4-month low. Consequently, Flash Germany Composite Index reported at 55.0 in March, down from 56.4 in February. 
$$$$
Eurozone PMI data reported in-line with flash estimates and showed service- and factory-sector activity growth slowed for the first time in four months. Flash Eurozone Services PMI Index reported at 52.4 (2-month low) in March and Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Index came in at 53.0 in March (3-month low). 
$$$$
Despite data reported in-line with flash estimates the Euro sank against 5 of its 7 major peers. According to DailyFX Strategist, Ilya Spivak says signs of softer performance may drive speculation about deepening disinflation. As a result the result the Euro may come under pressure on ECB stimulus expansion bets. Nonetheless, as the PMI index does not directly affect monetary policy follow through may be limited.

Annual German inflation fell to a 3-year low in March, but the news didn’t stop the Euro from rallying about 25 pips against the US Dollar at the time of the release. Before the release of the country’s inflation rate, regions throughout Germany had already reported lower regional March inflation rates earlier this morning. Therefore, it is possible that the weaker German inflation rate was already expected by many traders by the time of the release.
$$$$
Euro-zone inflation is likely the most important data release for Euro traders at the moment because of recent comments by various ECB members. Earlier this week, ECB’s Makuch warned that the central bank is preparing measures to avoid a deflationary environment. Therefore, lower inflation may push the ECB to take to take even looser monetary policy. That’s why the Euro rally on lower than expected German inflation may have caught many traders by surprise.

Eurozone’s benchmark year-on-year inflation rate fell for the third consecutive month and to the lowest level since November 2009. Preliminary Eurozone CPIcame in worse-than-expected at 0.5 percent in March, and missing expectations calling for a print of 0.6 percent. Moreover, this marks the sixth consecutive month that inflation is below 1 percent and well below European Central Bank’s (ECB) primary objective of maintaining the benchmark inflation rate below, but close to 2 percent. The soft outcome may fuel concerns about continued disinflation and drive speculation for a near-term expansion of ECB stimulus ahead of this week’s policy announcement. However, comments by ECB’s Weidmann made ahead of the inflation release may shine a light on policy action. 
$$$$
ECB’s Weidmann said that the drop in inflation is mostly cyclical. He attributes the deceleration of prices to energy and unprocessed food prices, and due to their cyclical nature expects this to be only temporary. He goes on to say that the Euro-Area recovery will pull inflation back up and that the ECB should only react to 2nd-round disinflation effects. This week is a critical week for the Euro and its fate depends on the outcome of the ECB policy meeting. Currency Analyst Chris Vecchio says there are signs that funding pressures may be building. He sees a shifting fundamental outlook due to ECB’s dovish rhetoric as of late, excess liquidity dropping and putting pressure on interbank lending rates, and EONIA showing conditions of tightening - the time for ECB action may be nearing.  
$$$$
The Euro fell against the US Dollar but quickly rebounded, and Currency Strategist Jamie Saettele sees a multiday rally back towards 1.3865.

The release of the final revision of March’s German CPI gave enough fuel for EURUSD to reach 1.3900. The benchmark year-on-year inflation rate confirmed at 1.0 percent and is the lowest level since June 2010. The month-on-month change matched initial estimates at 0.3 percent. European Central Bank policy makers continue to write off deflation as a risk to the Eurozone. ECB President Draghi said earlier in March that the high exchange rate creates headwinds for the Eurozone. Unable to talk the Euro lower  it appears that EURUSD is back on track towards 1.4000 that the ECB may begin to move bolstering bets on additional easing from the ECB. The following graph shows the benchmark year-on-year inflation rate in the Euro area. 
$$$$
The Euro popped higher against the U.S. Dollar after the data before returning to familiar overnight ranges. The euro has advanced against the US Dollar for four consecutive days and it appears that the euro rally has room to continue to 1.3928 then 1.4000. As of yesterday retail sentiment data shows that a mere 20% of retail traders remain long suggesting a further bullish trading bias.

The Euro plunged in Forex markets on Tuesday morning, as German annual inflation was reported below expectations for April and signaled higher chances of ECB action. Consumer prices rose 1.3% from April 2013, which was a three-month high for inflation, but still disappointed expectations for 1.4% annual rise in consumer prices. German annual inflation was reported at a three-year low in March at 1.0%. 
$$$$
Inflation has remained an important factor for the European Central Bank, as annual price changes remain below the ECB’s 2% target rate. Euro-zone wide inflation was reported at a four-year low of 0.5% in March, and inflation for April will be released tomorrow. ECB President Draghi warned recently that the central bank is open to broad based purchases of assets if consumer prices threaten the recovery.

Eurozone CPI for April reported worse-than-expected as preliminary figures saw inflation rise 0.7 percent, missing expectations calling for a print of 0.8 percent. Core-CPI reported in-line with estimates at 1.0 percent. Inflation in the Euro-zone and Euro area has disappointed severely. Earlier this week, German inflation figures missed expectations for April. 
$$$$
European Central Bank (ECB) policy makers have been grappling with low-inflation as annual price changes remain below the ECB’s 2 percent target rate. Sufficiently discouraging were March inflation figures that reported at a four-year low. Aside from the inflation environment, DailyFX Currency Analyst Christopher Vecchio warns of sour developments in the euro-area. 
$$$$
“Interbank lending pressures are creeping up, and now the overnight lending rate (EONIA) is above that of the ECB’s main reference rate: 0.294% (EONIA) versus 0.25% (ECB main refinancing rate),” says Vecchio, “simply put, as banks continue to deleverage for AQR (stress tests) due in November, credit creation and lending activity have fallen by the wayside, holding back potential economic growth.” He says the ECB might consider a smaller rate cut going forward.
$$$$
The Euro dipped immediately on the release, but instantly pared the losses to trade at 1.3829 resistance. DailyFX Technical Strategist Jamie Saettele says he is looking for a top. “This weak momentum profile is not suggestive of a strong bull (or bull at all for that matter),” says Saettele, “the failed rallies may warn of something sinister on the downside.”

German consumers’ appetite for shopping firmed in January as retail sales rose 2.5 percent, producing the largest monthly increase since February 2007 and surpassing estimates calling for 1 percent gain. On a year-on-year basis, retail spending rose 0.9 percent beating estimates calling for a decline of 1.7 percent.

The Euro resumed yesterday’s advance against the US Dollar following the upbeat report, but follow-through may prove lacking as traders continue to focus on the implications of lingering disinflation on European Central Bank Monetary (ECB) policy. That puts the spotlight on February’s flash Eurozone CPI print later today. A soft outcome mirroring yesterday’s analogous German CPI report may fuel bets on monetary stimulus expansion at next week’s interest rate decision, weighing on the single currency.

The French economy grew in the last quarter and for the second time in 2013 by 0.3 percent, beating expectations calling for a 0.2 percent increase. The German economy followed suit, growing by 0.4 percentand beating estimates pointing to a 0.3 percent increase. Though GDP is a backward looking indicator the metric is suggesting signs of a pick-up in overall output and could bode well for the Euro-zone economy.

The Euro extended yesterday's gains against the US Dollar following the set of better-than-expected French and German data. The fourth-quarter Eurozone GDP figure is on tap later in the day. The region-wide composite gauge is expected to show the year-on-year growth rate accelerated to 0.4 percent, marking the first positive reading in two years. Such an outcome may further boost the single currency amid ebbing ECB easing expectations after the central bank said that it will scrutinize incoming data before introducing further stimuluslast week.

The release of the final revision of January’s German CPI reading proved uneventful, with the benchmark year-on-year inflation rate confirmed at 1.3 percent and the month-on-month change matching initial estimates to show a -0.6 percent decline. 
$$$$
The Euro rose against the U.S. Dollar after the data in a move that may have reflected little more than the event’s passing. A downward revision might have bolstered bets on additional easing from the European Central Bank (ECB). Confirmation of the alternative scattered these concerns, allowing the single currency to drift toward the top of its overnight range against the greenback. According to DailyFX Analyst John Kicklighter, the Euro may find support on general risk trends as the ECB writes off deflation.

German PMI data came in mixed as service-sector activity reached a 3-month high, but factory-sector activity fell for the second consecutive month. Similarly, the Euro-zone service PMI gauge rose to a 5-month high in February, but factory-sector activity fell to a two-month low. Euro-zone PMI Composite index missed expectations and fell to 52.7 (two-month low). The Euro dipped as the news crossed the wires, but the true market mover was a set of disappointing German inflation data released earlier in session.
$$$$
The Euro sold off aggressively against most of its major counterparts as traders considered the implication on monetary policy after a disappointing German PPI report. The inflation gauge showed that month-on-month growth fell 0.1 percent in January, missing expectations calling for a 0.2 percent increase. Already pressuring the Euro lower was a set of hawkish FOMC minutes released early in the session boosting speculation that QE3 will fully be wound down as early as September, thus boosting demand for the US Dollar.

Through the beginning of 2014, investors have grown concerned about the stability of the global financial system as turmoil in the emerging markets encouraged a closer review of the system. In a recent survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the financial institution has offered a look into money managers’ (accounting for 145 managers and an approximate $456 billion in assets) expectations and concerns for the market. And, those concerns seem very similar to what we have seen from retail speculators. 
$$$$
Looking at the report, one of the most immediate highlights was the net 29% of respondents reported being underweight on the Emerging Market – a record. This concern moved up the scale with a net 40% worried that China’s economy would slow further, and those expecting a stronger global economy slipped to 56% from 75% the month before. Furthermore, ‘cash’ holdings (pulling out of speculative exposure) rose to 4.8% for the highest level of unease since July 2012. Perhaps one contradiction was the survey’s report that a net 28% of participants were ‘overweight’ bank shares – also a record. This may indicate while fund managers have adjusted, they have not fully given up on ‘risk’.
$$$$
FXCM’s Speculative Sentiment Index presents evidence that the risk profile has shifted for retail traders as well. According to how retail traders are positioned, we find exposure to S&P 500 CFDs is 2.18 shorts per every 1 long (-2.18). With further risk exposure of their own, EURUSD positioning stands at -3.68, GBPUSD at -3.99 and NZDUSD (a carry trade pair) at -3.62.

The Euro was little-changed as revised GDP data showed the German economy continued to grow moderately in the fourth quarter. The final revision of 4Q’13 German GDP came in as expected, with the benchmark year-on-year growth rate confirmed at 1.3 percent and the month-on-month change matching earlier estimates to show a 0.4 percent rise. German GDP headlined event risk in European trading hours, but inflation data continues to draw a stronger and lasting response as it directly shapes European Central Bank’s (ECB) monetary policy. Yesterday, the Eurozone CPI figure for January dropped a record 1.1 percent, and now traders shift their focus to Thursday’s February CPI for further directional cues on ECB’s monetary policy.

German unemployment fell for the third consecutive month to the lowest level since September 2012 in February. Deutsche Bundesbank reported that people out of work decreased by 14,000, beating estimates calling for a drop of 10,000. The unemployment rate remained at 6.8 percent. 
$$$$
The Euro dropped against most of its major peers despite the positive figures as traders considered the policy implication of continued disinflation in the Eurozone’s top economy on the ECB policy outlook. Indeed, the single currency began to slide after CPI data from Saxony – one of the federal states that make up the Republic of Germany – hit a four-month low in February. This foreshadowed a weaker overall German CPI print later in the day, which DailyFX Strategist Ilya Spivak argues could drive a pickup in ECB stimulus expansion speculation.

$$$$
The Dow Jones FXCM US Dollar Index saw bits of intraday volatility through this week’s trading, but the greenback looks ready to only close about 40 points lower than the weekly open at the time of this writing. There were no major events in this week’s calendar that were worthy of a major shift in US Dollar trading. 
$$$$
The greenback fell lower through Monday and Tuesday trading, despite a lack of significant news releases. But those losses were erased over Wednesday’s London session, and the greenback gains were extended on the release of a surprise rise in US New Home Sales in January.
$$$$
However, those gains were erased on Thursday during Yellen’s testimony to the Senate. Yellen strongly supported a continuation of the current pace of taper, making the greenback selloff slightly mysterious from a fundamental perspective. 
$$$$
Friday’s trading saw a release of higher than expected Euro-zone inflation, which sent EUR/USD 75 pips higher. Then, US GDP slightly missed expectations for Q4, which sent the dollar lower. But neither release had a lasting effect on greenback trading, and the dollar continues to trade around 10,550 at the time of this writing.

The Euro resumed yesterday’s recovery against the US Dollar after an uneventful set of economic data failed to offer new direction cues. German Unemployment fell 15,000 in December, beating expectations calling for a 1,000 decline. EUR/USD initially moved lower following the outcome but prices swiftly recovered as investors awaited the release of flash Eurozone CPI data.
$$$$
That report proved little more eventful: the benchmark year-on-year inflation rate slowed to 0.8 percent as expected, offering little that would disrupt the ECB policy outlook status quo. With the day’s scheduled event risk in the rearview mirror, the single currency seems to have returned to the dynamic prevalent over the preceding 24 hours, correcting higher against the greenback having tumbled dramatically in the first two trading days of 2014.

$$$$
The Euro has plunged to fresh session lows and its lowest level in four days against the US Dollar, after a slew of central bank chatter from both sides of the Atlantic has traders quickly adjusting their holdings.
$$$$
Out of Europe, reports have hit the newswires that the European Central Bank would consider cutting its main refinancing rate to negative territory, as a way to stimulate credit growth (the idea is that banks would rather lend their money for a small profit margin than keep it parked with the ECB at a charge). While various policymakers have rejected negative deposit speculation in the past, in light of the ECB’s historic rate cut at the beginning of November, further dovish action may not be that far-fetched in market participants’ eyes, should growth and inflation continue to suffer.
$$$$
Shortly after, FOMC voting member Bullard said that tapering quantitative easing is still on the table for the December Fed meeting. He commented that a strong job report in November would increase the chances of a December taper, and he said that the jobs picture is looking better. 
$$$$
Following the Fed’s surprise no-taper decision in September, US Dollar traders have been carefully watching for signs of when the first slowdown of the 85 billion dollars of monthly asset purchases will begin. Fed Chairman Bernanke said in June that the Fed will probably taper its bond purchases later in 2013, but he has since scaled back his confidence in a taper in 2013.
$$$$
Whereas EUR/USD traded as high as 1.3582 overnight, the pair touched 1.3455, just as the first full hour of trading in US markets concluded. The EUR/USD may next see support by the 100-day moving average at 1.3379.

inflation outlook to remain low over the coming months

"	"
Despite Mr. Draghi’s attempt to talk the Euro lower last month, his press conference today had the opposite impact with the most telling statements by the ECB President coming from comments on inflation and the Euro exchange rate. 
$$$$
Inflation prints came in at the lowest levels since February 2011 on Monday and monthly readings continue to miss ECB targets to the downside. Mr. Draghi went as far as being bluntly honest in saying that the inflation outlook would remain low over the coming months. All in all, the comments were in line with what most would expect from the head of the ECB. Market participants had been looking for Mr. Draghi to talk up the possible LTRO that he mentioned last week, but were disappointed in not gaining further insight. This development points to an ECB that is only willing to reinitiate an LTRO when it is absolutely necessary and no sooner. With an ECB that is overly optimistic at times, improved confidence prints may have the potential to cloud the central bank’s analysis of the Euro-Zone and delay necessary measures for long-term EU progress.

The EUR/USD pair hit 7 month highs on Draghi’s comments and hit 1.36 for the first time since the 4th of February. One of the strongest moves during the press conference came from comments in response to questions about the Euro exchange rate. Mr. Draghi stated the rate was not one of the ECB’s policy targets and that the central bank was simply ‘attentive’ to developments. During the Draghi press conference, announcements of Prime Minister Letta winning a confidence vote in the Italian Senate hit the wires thus proving further strength for the Euro.

The Empire State Manufacturing Survey unexpectedly fell to a 4-month law and sent the US Dollar 10 to 15 pips lower against majors like the Euro and Yen. The New York based manufacturing survey was reported at 6.29 for September, disappointing expectations for 9.10 and down from 8.24 in August. 
$$$$
The reaction may have been augmented by US Dollar traders’ sensitivities to all US economic news in the days before the possible announcement of a taper of quantitative easing. The US industrial production release at 13:15 GMT may have even more of an impact on greenback trading, if the release deviates from expectations.

$$$$
The Euro declined about 20 pips against the US Dollar, as European Central Bank President Draghi said that he expects key interest rates to remain at current or lower levels given the subdued inflation rate.
$$$$
The comments were similar to those Draghi made following the August ECB meeting. However, the August comments were soon contradicted by a statement by the Bundesbank saying that the ECB doesn’t rule out a rate increase. Draghi also added today that the Euro-zone economy remains fragile and unemployment is far too high. 
$$$$
Furthermore, inflation was confirmed today to have fallen back to 1.3% in August, barely above a 3-year low at 1.2% and well below the ECB’s 2% target inflation rate. The lower inflation rate allows or may lead the central bank to remain accommodative, as was referred to by Draghi. 
$$$$
The Euro is currently trading around 1.3350 against the greenback at the time of this writing. The pair may see resistance by a 7-month high, currently sitting at 1.3451.

The European Central Bank President Mario Draghi commented today on the European recovery and offered some updates onforward guidance for GDP/inflation. Although Mr. Draghi cited higher confidence indicators as a key positive factor in the Eurozone, the fact that he mentioned EU growth risks still being on the ‘downside’ weighed heavily as traders sold the Euro into the open of US equities.  
$$$$
Mr. Draghi, speaking on behalf of the ECB, raised 2013 GDP forecasts from -0.6% to -0.4% while lowering those for 2014 from 1.1% to 1.0%. Inflation forecasts for 2013 were also raised by a tenth of a percent to 1.5% as Draghi cited risks of higher commodity prices.

$$$$
Euro-zone Gross Domestic Product was confirmed to have grown 0.3% in the second quarter, according to Eurostat’s second estimate. The 0.3% rise in GDP ended six quarters of economic recession and set a new 2-year high in quarterly expansion. However, the annual decline in GDP was revised lower to -0.5% in Q2 from a previous estimate of an annual 0.7% economic contraction. 
$$$$
Household consumption expanded by 0.2% in the second quarter, beating expectations for 0.1% and up from the 0.2% decline in consumption in Q1. Also, retail sales only rose by 0.1% in July, according to a release today.
$$$$
Euro traders have been looking for a rebound in the Euro-zone economy following the debt crisis, and an earlier release of the PMI’s for August suggested that economic expansion may continue into the third quarter. ECB President Draghi said in June that he expects the Euro-zone to return to growth by the end of the year, but the ECB predicted a 0.6% decline in GDP in 2013. 
$$$$
However, the Euro did not significantly react to the updated GDP release. EUR/USD may again see resistance at 1.3193, by the 38.2% retracement of the rally from the pair’s all-time low to the all-time high. The key 1.3000 key level may provide support.

The Euro-zone PMI composite output index for August was revised slightly lower, but still set a new 2-year high, according to the final estimate by Markit. The composite index was revised lower to 51.5 from a previous 51.7 estimate for August, but up from 50.5 in July. The final Euro-zone Purchasing Managers’ Index for services was revised lower to 50.7 from 51.0, but was still reported above the 50.0 neutral line for the first time in a year and a half.
$$$$
Markit reported that the main factor behind the faster expanding output was a growth in new order inflows in August for the first time since July 2011. However, job losses were reported for the twentieth consecutive month. Composite output for Germany was reported at a 7-month high at 53.5, while France’s output fell in August to 48.8. 
$$$$
The Euro-zone economy emerged from a recession in the second quarter of this year, by expanding by 0.3% on a quarterly basis. That GDP number will be revised later today in s Eurostat release at 09:00 GMT. Markit estimated that GDP expansion may even decline slightly in the third quarter. “Although the picture is improving, the survey is still consistent with only very modest economic growth of approximately 0.2% in the third quarter,” said Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson.
$$$$
The Euro declined about 15 pips against the US Dollar, as some of the PMI releases across the Euro-zone slightly disappointed expectations and previous estimates. EUR/USD may again see resistance at 1.3193, by the 38.2% retracement of the rally from the pair’s all-time low to the all-time high. The key 1.3000 level may provide support.

Fed’s Bullard suggests a possible taper in October

Dovish inflation comments ignored by markets

US Dollar rallies following recent losses

Want to trade with proprietary strategies developed by FXCM? Find out how here.
$$$$
The US Dollar rose 35 pips against the Euro, as voting Federal Open Market Committee member Bullard said a small taper is possible in October.
$$$$
The comments surprised Forex traders after the Fed went against expectations in its monthly meeting on Wednesday and didn’t taper its 85 billion Dollars of monthly quantitative easing. Many were looking to December as the next opportunity to taper, as that was scheduled to be the next meeting accompanied by a press conference, but Bullard said a press conference may also follow October’s meeting.
$$$$
Despite the significant declines in US Dollar following the Wednesday decision, Bullard said today that 10 billion Dollars of taper versus no taper is not a big thing and mentioned that no taper was a borderline call. He also added that 7% unemployment is a soft guidepost for quantitative easing, and the falling participation rate is mostly structural. 
$$$$
However, Bullard also released some dovish sounding comments, telling Bloomberg that he has been a little concerned that the Fed is too focused on jobs and the central bank must also hit a 2% inflation target. The inflation comments were not given as much market focus as the taper talk.
$$$$
The Fed has pegged monetary policy to the unemployment rate, which was most recently reported as falling to 7.3% in August from 7.4% in July. However, labor participation was reported at a 35-year low in August, making the unemployment numbers tougher to interpret as positive. 
$$$$
The taper talk sent EUR/USD lower and just short of crossing under 1.3500 in Forex trading. A broken resistance level around 1.3400 may now provide support, and a 7-month high set yesterday at 1.3568 may see resistance.

$$$$
The Euro erased a weekend gap against the US Dollar and gained an additional 35 pips on a headline lending hope to the Italian government maintaining stability. 
$$$$
Reports are circling that as many as 20 Senators from Berlusconi’s PDL party are ready to form a breakaway party, suggesting they would maintain support for PM Letta’s coalition. This news follows a late Friday announcement that Berlusconi pulled his party’s ministers from the cabinet, casting doubt on PM Letta’s ability to survive a confidence vote that will take place this Wednesday. Berlusconi was threatening to withdraw his support for the coalition after legal problems have led the right wing leader to face a possible Senate expulsion.
$$$$
Letta needs a faction of Berlusconi’s party to breakaway or for additional support from opposition Senators to win the upcoming confidence vote. A breakup of the current coalition is possibly Euro negative, as it could lead to the election of a less austerity-prone government, which could drive up the yields on government bonds and create Euro-zone instability.
$$$$
The Euro continues to trade slightly below 1.3550 against the US Dollar, and the pair may see resistance by a nine month high at 1.3568. A broken resistance line around 1.3400 may now provide support.

$$$$
German annual inflation set a new five month low in September, but the decline in consumer prices failed to stop the Euro’s move higher. 
$$$$
The consumer price index rose 1.4% from September 2012, less than expectations for the annual inflation to remain unchanged from August’s 1.5% rate. The German CPI did not change on a monthly basis, according to a preliminary estimate by the Federal Statistical Office.
$$$$
Germany is the biggest economy in the Euro-zone, where inflation for the whole region was reported at 1.3% in August and well below the ECB’s target 2.0% inflation rate. In September, ECB President Draghi repeated that he expects interest rates to remain at current or lower levels, and the below-target inflation rate allows the central bank to maintain accommodative policy without worries of driving prices higher at a faster than desired rate. Therefore, declining inflation should be Euro negative. 
$$$$
However, the Euro did not react significantly to today’s German inflation release. EUR/USD continues to trade around 1.3550 in Forex markets at the time of this writing, following an earlier rise to a new weekly high. A seven month high recently set at 1.3568 may provide resistance, and support may come in by the key 1.3500 level.

A Disappointing Non-Manufacturing ISM Sends Dollar for a Temporary Tumble	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2013/10/03/A_Disappointing_Non-Manufacturing_ISM_Sends_Dollar_for_a_Temporary_Tumble.html	1380811320	"
ISM index for non-manufacturing disappoints expectations at 54.4

All economic releases fall under taper scrutiny

$$$$
After the ISM non-manufacturing index set a new seven year high in August, the index declined significantly in September, sending the US Dollar lower against the Euro. 
$$$$
The Institute for Supply Management reported the index measuring non-manufacturing sector activity at 54.4, disappointing expectations for 57.0 and down from 58.6 in August. The 54.4 print indicates the 45th consecutive month of sector growth, as it was reported above the 50.0 neutral line. The non-manufacturing employment index declined 4.3 percentage points to 52.7 in September, according to ISM. 
$$$$
All economic releases from the US are currently being inspected with the underlying question of how it will affect the Fed’s decision when to taper its 85 billion US Dollars of monthly quantitative easing. The Fed defied expectations in September by not beginning to taper its stimulus, and the central bank also lowered its GDP forecast for 2013 to 2.0% to 2.3% growth. The Fed has pegged its monetary policy to the unemployment rate, and therefore declining economic indicators like the ISM index may delay the taper decision and are therefore US Dollar negative.
$$$$
That’s why the US Dollar declined as much as 25 pips against the Euro following the disappointing non-manufacturing index release. However, those losses were temporary and EUR/USD continues to trade slightly above the 1.3600 level. A previous 6-month high at 1.3451 may provide support, while resistance may come in at 1.3710, which is the current yearly high and near the top of an upward trend channel.

Nowotny Reveals ECB Rate Cut is Unlikely, Euro Rallies	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2013/10/29/Nowotny_Reveals_ECB_Rate_Cut_is_Unlikely_Euro_Rallies.html	1383058920	"
ECB’s Nowotny reveals there is no realistic prospect of a rate cut

Nowotny says may have to live with a strong Euro
$$$$
EUR/USD rallies above 1.3800

Talking Points: 
$$$$
Want to trade with proprietary strategies developed by FXCM? Find out how here.
$$$$
The Euro jumped about fifty pips against the US Dollar on ECB’s Nowotny’s revelation that there is no realistic prospect of a cut to the benchmark interest rate. The president of the Austrian central bank said that policy makers will have to live with a strong Euro, and he also mentioned that the European Central Bank will not likely cut the deposit rate either.
$$$$
Nowotny’s comments contradicted ECB President Draghi, who said earlier this month that the rate will remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time. Draghi had mentioned in June that cutting the deposit rate into negative territory was one of the unconventional tools being considered at the time. The ECB has kept the interest rate at 0.5% since a 25 basis point cut in May of this year.
$$$$
Therefore, Nowotny’s comments suggest that a rate cut is not really on the table, and he further confirmed Draghi’s refusal to suggest a Euro exchange intervention earlier in the month. Draghi did mention in October that improved economic points, like a more optimistic consumer confidence, reflect a start of an economic recovery in the Euro-zone. An end to ECB rate cuts and an eventual turn to the possibility of raising the interest rate are Euro positive.
$$$$
The Euro rose above 1.3800 against the US Dollar following Nowotny’s comments. EUR/USD may see resistance by the near 2-year high set recently at 1.3832, and support may come in by a previous high set at 1.3710.

US Dollar Slide Continues After More Weak June Housing Data	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2013/07/22/US_Dollar_Slide_Continues_After_More_Weak_June_Housing_Data.html	1374503100	"

$$$$
The jump in US mortgage rates over the past several weeks has put the housing market recovery on ice, as the fastest rise in US Treasury yields since 1994 has home buyers exhibiting a bit more hesitance than previously thought. The June Existing Home Sales completes the trifecta of weak June US housing data, which will inevitable force US monetary policymakers to rethink the path of unwinding QE3. For context, here are the three big June misses (first discussed in today’s Morning Slices report):
$$$$
During June, the national 30-year average mortgage rate, according to Bankrate.com, jumped from 4.10% to 4.39%, a +7.07% monthly increase. This quick rise pales in comparison to the jump in mortgage rates in May, when the same rate rose by +19.53%, from 3.43% to 4.10%. Given the implication that borrowing costs are rising, a further sustained increase in US yields has negative implications for the US housing market, and thus, for the US Dollar. Already today, US Dollar weakness has transpired in the wake of the soft housing data.

"	"
THE TAKEAWAY:  Spain approves 2013 budget and reform package > Budget to tap pension reserve fund to help banking sector debt; suggests Spain to tackle debt crisis internally >  EURUSD bullish
$$$$
The Spanish Cabinet approved the nation’s 2013 budget and economic reform package today, which will see the government passing 43 new laws to reform the economy over the next six months. In a news conference following the cabinet meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria and Finance Minister Cristobal Montoro said that the budget is designed to end Spain’s debt crisis, asserting their confidence that Spain will meet its 2012 deficit target and optimism that 2013 will mark the end of recession in Spain 
$$$$
The budget will focus on current spending rather than revenues, with around 64 percent of the budget continuing to go towards “social spending” such as pensions and benefits despite the proposed spending cuts.  
$$$$
Amid the positive rhetoric from the Spanish ministers, there is only one key change to the budget that is worth noting, which is that the Spanish government will tap into the nation’s pension reserve fund to help its financial sector. In short, this change suggests that the Spanish government is aiming to tackle its banking debt crisis internally, rather than looking for external aid in the form of an international bailout package. However, with Spain continuing to face a deteriorating economy and a 25 percent unemployment rate, and Spanish bond yields at elevated rates, concerns remain that the government itself may still need rescuing in coming months.

$$$$
The news keeps getting worse for the US economy, which as of a few months ago was the world’s darling economy and now has become just another blight on the global growth picture. Three ‘medium’ importance data releases (according to the DailyFX Economic Calendar) for the US economy were released at 10:00 EDT / 14:00 GMT, and all three disappointed. To wit:
$$$$
The data comes at a crucial time as the Federal Reserve weighs more stimuli measures to help improve growth prospects, but questions remain over what exactly will be done. As was made clear over the past two-days per Chairman Ben Bernanke’s Semi-Annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress, while the Federal Reserve can do more if necessary, the necessary structural improvements to the economy will only come by way of a more prudent fiscal policy. Until the US’ feckless fiscal policy is corrected, the US economy will continue to struggle, regardless of what the Federal Reserve does.

UPDATE: US Dollar Rally Resumes Following Bernanke Testimony.$$$$
EURUSD 5-min Chart: June 20, 2012
$$$$
Charts Created using Marketscope – Prepared by Christopher Vecchio
$$$$Following Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony, the US Dollar has regained some of its losses (and lost gains), and is now the top performer on the day. The EURUSD, after rebounding to 1.2743, has since fallen back to 1.2657.$$$$
THE TAKEAWAY:Federal Open Market Committee Policy Meeting > Operation Twist Extended Through 2012 > No QE3 (yet) > AUDUSD, EURUSD Bearish; USDJPY Bullish
$$$$
The Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting concluded today, and the first of the three major events surrounding the meeting has come across the wires. The Federal Reserve announced that it would keep its key interest rate on hold at 0.25 percent, as expected, but the big news was whether or not the Fed would choose to ease further. Indeed they have; but is it what the market wanted?
$$$$
Instead of opting for a full-blow QE3 package, the Fed decided that it would instead extend Operation Twist. The extension, which will take place through the end of the year, will result in another $267 billion of purchases in the 6 to 30 year bond range, with those funds coming from sales of short tenor securities. As noted in our FOMC Preview, the Fed has just under $200 billion of short tenor securities left on its balance sheet.

The EURUSD dropped from 1.2690 ahead of the policy statement release to as low as 1.2636 in the minutes soon after; however, a flurry of comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggesting that the EFSF/ESM could be used to help ease pressures in crisis-affected sovereign bond markets.

Unlike the EURUSD, the USDJPY rallied on the policy statement, and even after Chancellor Merkel’s comments, the pair remained elevated. The USDJPY is perhaps one of the best “tells” of the QE3 trade, in the sense that both currencies are considered safe havens and track Treasury yields closely; by no indication has the USDJPY thus far indicated that market participants are pricing in a higher likelihood of more easing in the coming weeks.

Euro Tanks, U.S. Dollar Surges on Bernanke Testimony	https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/market_alert/2012/02/29/Euro_Tanks_U.S._Dollar_Surges_on_Bernanke_Testimony1.html	1330532640	"
Private payroll employment has increased by 165,000 jobs per month on average since the middle of last year, and nearly 260,000 new private-sector jobs were added in January. 
$$$$
The job gains in recent months have been relatively widespread across industries. In the public sector, by contrast, layoffs by state and local governments have continued. 
$$$$
The unemployment rate hovered around 9 percent for much of last year but has moved down appreciably since September, reaching 8.3 percent in January. New claims for unemployment insurance benefits have also moderated.
$$$$
Household spending advanced moderately in the second half of last year, boosted by a fourth-quarter surge in motor vehicle purchases that was facilitated by an easing of constraints on supply related to the earthquake in Japan.
$$$$
In the housing sector, affordability has increased dramatically as a result of the decline in house prices and historically low interest rates on conventional mortgages.
$$$$
On the supply side of the market, about 30 percent of recent home sales have consisted of foreclosed or distressed properties, and home vacancy rates remain high, putting downward pressure on house prices.
$$$$
Manufacturing production has increased 15 percent since the trough of the recession and has posted solid gains since the middle of last year, supported by the recovery in motor vehicle supply chains and ongoing increases in business investment and exports.

THE TAKEAWAY: [Fed Chairman Bernanke’s Semi-Annual Testimony ] > [Committee Critical of Dual-Mandate; Bernanke Less Dovish] > [USDollar Bullish]

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was on Capitol Hill today testifying in front of the Committee on Financial Services. Despite overall dovish undertones, the chairman’s testimony was markedly less-dovish than recent Federal Reserve communiqués, boosting the U.S. Dollar across the board.

At the time this report was written, the EURUSD had taken a dramatic spill, falling from 1.3460 to as low as 1.3370, at the time this report was written. Similar price action was observed across other U.S. Dollar-based pairs, in particular the AUDUSD and NZDUSD.The Dow Jones FXCM Dollar Index (Ticker: USDOLLAR) is trading higher on the developments, from 9740.41 to as high as 9809.01.

Chairman Bernanke, in his semi-annual testimony, noted that “the recovery of the U.S. economy continues, but the pace of expansion ‘has been uneven and modest’ by historical standards.” Going forward, the Federal Open Market Committee projects “growth in real GDP in 2012 [with] a central tendency of 2.2 to 2.7 percent, which are considerably lower than the proejctions made last June.”
$$$$
In regards to unemployment, the chairman said that the “decline in the unemployment rate over the past year has been ‘more rapid’ than expected.” However, as he noted, “the job market remains far from normal…The unemployment rate remains elevated, long-term unemployment is still near record levels, and the number of persons working part time for economic reasons is very high.”

Dollar Traders More Interested in S&P 500 than Housing and Bernanke
$$$$
This past trading day was another one of consolidation, and the safe haven dollar would certainly oblige the underlying churn. Yet, congestion can prove constructive if it leads to a meaningful drive later on. Technical traders can point out the periods of chop and tight ranges pretty easily – the picture on the chart is rather straightforward, but there is a fundamental reason to this period of indecision as well. Either there is little pressure building behind both sides of the market (bulls and bears) and it thereby balances, or there is a lot of interest on both sides but the strength is subsequently offsetting. Finding equilibrium in a single market under heavy open interest is difficult enough, much less for the broader capital markets. What we are facing is a low participation chop. Fresh blood is holding to the sidelines until it is clear that there is another market-wide run that they can draw capital gains from or a wholesale unwinding that they need to keep up with.
$$$$
This is the situation the entire market faces, and the dollar is standing as the last-resort safe haven in the middle of it. Looking at the Dow Jones FXCM Dollar, we see that the currency is consolidating within a week-long range with a mid-point near 10,000. Yet, this anchor happens is just around 100 points away from the range resistance that has held the currency back from charging to highs last seen in January 2011 and possibly reviving a still-shapeless bull trend. What we need is that critical breakout and the fundamental drive needed to keep it moving (preferably, the latter instigating the former). There is little on the immediate docket that could promise the thematic level of influence. In the meantime, we were offered updates on the housing sector and Fed Chairman Bernanke’s opinions this past session. Existing home sales slipped 0.9 percent, but nevertheless kept the measure near a two-year high while the median price posted its first year-over-year increase in 15 months. It is a long road to a full housing recovery, but it is looking more and more like a floor is in place for the United States’ biggest fundamental anchor. As for Bernanke, he voiced support of a strong dollar and said it was an encouraging sign that there are no AIG’s now.
$$$$
Euro Shudders as Market Considers Spain Disaster Scenario, PMI Data Ahead
$$$$
The market doesn’t usually react to comments made by economists or analysts, but there was a notable euro reaction Tuesday to Citi’s Chief Economist when he sounded the alarm on Spain and its troubled housing sector. Spanish bonds were notably underperforming with yields on the 10-year government bond posting its biggest jump in two months to hit a five-week high. There are plenty of loose ends for the Euro Zone that are on fire, but they are not immediate threats to stability. Another concern to monitor: Ireland is scheduled to make a €3.1 billion payment on its €31 bank bailout from three years ago by March 30. Irish officials are trying to win a deferment on that payment. In the upcoming trading session, the German and Euro Zone growth figures for March will offer a good, timely growth update – and possibly volatility. 
$$$$
New Zealand Dollar Tumbles after 4Q GDP Figures Fall Short of Expectations
$$$$
The New Zealand economy grew at half the pace expected through the final three months and the annual figure leveled off. According to Statistics New Zealand, the country grew 0.3 percent against a market consensus of 0.6 percent growth. Though that doesn’t necessarily turn any corners for recession talk, the market was clearly positioning for a specific outcome because the immediate reaction to the disappointing news was an across-the-board selloff. The slide hasn’t necessarily secured its own trend (it’s difficult to run astray from risk trends even when they are flat), but the kiwi hasn’t recovered much of that lost ground. With the weak Chinese data, this slide could end up permanent.
$$$$
British Pound Absorbs Dovish BoE Minutes, Slightly Accommodative Budget
$$$$
There was a lot of ambiguous event risk behind the sterling Wednesday, but the masses had a pretty good idea for what would come of the two key events. For the budget presentation to Parliament, we saw a lot of the changes that were expected, met. The top tax rate was eased back from 50 percent, the corporate tax rate will be lowered to 24 percent and the stamp duty on homes over £2 million was raised to 7 percent. Perhaps most surprising was the 0.8 percent growth forecast for 2012. The other event was the BoE minutes. Two voters (Posen and Miles) called for another £25 billion in bonds but the majority said the watch must continue on medium-term inflation.  
$$$$
Australian Dollar Stumbles on Weak Chinese Manufacturing Report
$$$$
There was a little event risk to start the Australian dollar off Wednesday morning, but its influence was tepid. The real market mover was a release from another country’s docket: the flash Chinese Manufacturing activity report for May from HSBC. A 48.1 reading marks the fifth consecutive contraction (anything below a 50 read) in factory activity. This is a damper on collective global growth expectations but it carries more weight with the Aussie dollar than most other trade partners. The manufacturing sector (China’s largest) requires raw materials and energy products to run – goods Australia provides much of. So, when this important consumer of Aussie exports fades, the currency takes a hit.
$$$$
Japanese Yen: Trade Balance Posts Unexpected Surplus Following Record Deficit
$$$$
What a dramatic reversal in trade figures. In January, the country reported a record 1.477 trillion yen deficit – a strong argument for those that want to make the case that a high yen is choking the economy. Yet, this morning we learn that February saw a return to surplus (32.9 billion yen). While his isn’t too surprising as the forecast was for a 120 billion deficit, the fundamental shift is clear. The yen itself looks primed and ready for a natural correction after its aggressive selloff these past few months, but it needs a real driver. A risk aversion move that encourages carry unwind could certainly accomplish that - but we need that break first…
$$$$
Gold Working Itself Deeper into Congestion, Volatility at Eight Month Low and Volume Contracting
$$$$
There was no progress made for gold this past session. The high and lows of Wednesday’s range fit within the highs and lows of the previous session. Progress has clearly bled off with volatility and volume figures seconding the temperance. The CBOE’s gold volatility reading is dragging its belly along eight-month lows while futures volume from the past session was at a multi-week low. This could prove a contraction before a breakout, but like the traditional risk assets, we need a catalyst. Look to the dollar to lead the metal.

THE TAKEAWAY: [Spain, Belgium, Italy, Slovenia, Cyprus Ratings Downgraded by Fitch] >  [Euro Strengthens]
$$$$
Fitch took ratings actions on six Euro-zone sovereigns today, resulting in downgrades of five nations. The downgrades follow the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) placed on the six nations, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Slovenia, Cyprus and Ireland, on December 16, 2011.  
$$$$
EUR/USD 1-minute Chart: 27 January 2012
$$$$
Chart created using Strategy Trader– Prepared by Tzu-Wen Chen
$$$$
Despite the sovereign credit downgrades, the Euro remained to climb against the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar remains weak, as investors continue to await news on a Greek deal being reached.
$$$$
The ratings actions on the long-term (LT) and short-term (ST) Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) are as follows:
$$$$
In the release, Fitch noted the following rationale for today’s downgrades:
$$$$
As outlined in its rating review press release of 16 December 2011, Fitch has now considered both systemic and country-specific factors for these six sovereigns. As a result, the agency has reduced the score it assigns to capture financing flexibility in its assessment of the credit profiles of eurozone sovereigns that have large fiscal financing needs and significant financial/economic imbalances.
$$$$
Moreover, rising ""home bias"" in the allocation of capital, the divergence in monetary and credit conditions across the eurozone, and near-term economic outlook highlight the greater vulnerability to monetary as well as financing shocks faced by these sovereign governments. Consequently, these sovereigns do not, in Fitch's view, accrue the full benefits of the euro's reserve currency status. The net impact of this revision under Fitch's sovereign rating methodology is to lower the long-term ratings of the affected sovereigns by one notch. 
$$$$
Overall, today's rating actions balance the marked deterioration in the economic outlook with both the substantive policy initiatives at the national level to address macro-financial and fiscal imbalances, and the initial success of the ECB's three-year Long-Term Refinancing Operation in easing near-term sovereign and bank funding pressures. Nonetheless, the intensification of the eurozone crisis in the latter half of last year undermined the effectiveness of ECB monetary policy and highlighted the financing risks faced by eurozone sovereign governments in the absence of a credible financial firewall against contagion and self-fulfilling liquidity crises. 
$$$$
The Negative Outlooks on eight eurozone countries (the six sovereigns in this review along with 'AAA'-rated France and 'BB+'-rated Portugal) primarily reflect the risk that the crisis could intensify further. A deeper and more prolonged economic recession than currently anticipated would undermine political support for, and public acceptance of, fiscal austerity and structural reform. It would also have the potential to weaken the commitment of the economically and fiscally strongest eurozone countries, and the ECB, to providing necessary support to eurozone peers. 
$$$$
Fitch currently views that the sovereign credit profiles of the remaining eurozone sovereign governments (with the exception of 'CCC'-rated Greece, which has no Outlook assigned) continue to warrant Stable Outlooks, though each will be subject to active review through the course of the year. Fitch will consider on a country-by-country basis the extent to which the risks associated with the crisis, as well as the limitations on monetary and financial flexibility within the eurozone revealed by the crisis, may impact their long-term sovereign credit profiles.

THE TAKEAWAY: [European Troika Releases Draft ]  >  [More Harsh Austerity on Greece]  >  [EUR/USD Neutral]
$$$$
After days of intense negotiations, the European Troika finally released their draft of what they are demanding of Greece, in order for the country to receive additional bailout funds. European officials have noted that if a deal isn’t agreed upon and approved by February 15 by Greece, the Euro-zone, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, there isn’t enough time to complete the legal process that would prevent a Greek default on March 20, the date of a bond redemption for Greece.
$$$$
Some of the notes and proposed measures from the Troika’s draft include:

$$$$
In reaction to the news, the Euro failed to gain any traction versus the U.S. Dollar, gaining a mere 2-pips following the release of the draft. Market participants have seemingly priced in the resolution of this event, considering that the EUR/USD has rallied 4.99 percent since January 16. At the time this report was written, the EUR/USD was holding steady at 1.3261.

"	"
Risk correlated assets remain very well bid on any form of a dip in 2012 thus far, and higher yielding currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars continue to outperform as a result. Though we remain skeptical with the prospects for any significant additional strength in these markets, for now, it is best to stay sidelined until the choppy trade figures itself out. Economic data out from both Australian and New Zealand have been solid on Wednesday to further the relative outperformance in these currencies. In the broader scheme of things market participants seem to be finding comfort in the latest comments from China in which the country has talked of upping its exposure to the Eurozone. 
$$$$
Relative performance versus the USD Wednesday (as of 11:50GMT)
$$$$
Moving on, headlines relating to Greece were all over the European session, with doubts surfacing on the country’s ability meet all necessary conditions for bailout. But the Greece news and some consensus Eurozone GDP failed to factor into price action, while solid auction results from Portugal were see as somewhat supportive. Finally, employment data out of the UK was mixed, while the BOE inflation report revealed a firmer than expected CPI forecast of 1.8% in two years. 
$$$$
Still, we see risk correlated assets exposed over the coming days, with global equities looking technically overdone and poised for a more sizeable corrective retreat. At this point, it is hard to anticipate the potential catalyst, but we will most certainly be on the lookout. Elsewhere, the big story in the FX market has come out of Japan, where the Yen has been making some serious moves that could help define the longer-term outlook for the currency. USD/JPY has broken back above the 200-Day SMA for the first time in several months, while also managing to break to fresh 2012 highs beyond 78.30. Next key resistance comes in by the October highs at 79.55 and we look for a test of this level over the coming sessions. The move by the BOJ on Tuesday to increase its quantitative easing policy has been driving the relative underperformance in the Yen which is a very welcome development for Japanese officials who have been discomforted by the rapid appreciation in the local currency in recent years.  
$$$$
ECONOMIC CALENDAR
$$$$
TECHNICAL OUTLOOK
$$$$
EUR/USD:  Remains locked in a choppy consolidation with the market now needing a break back above 1.3325 or below 1.3025 for clearer directional bias. Overall, our core outlook remains bearish and we are on the lookout for the formation of a fresh medium-term lower top ahead of underlying bear trend resumption off of the 2008 record highs. At this point, we are sidelined but would not rule out the possibility for a move towards 1.3500 before gains eventually stall. 
$$$$
USD/JPY:The market has broken back above the 200-Day SMA for the first time in several months, while also managing to break to fresh 2012 highs beyond 78.30. Next key resistance comes in by the October highs at 79.55 and we look for a test of this level over the coming sessions. We could be in the process of seeing a major structural shift and once 79.55 is cleared, confirmation will be given. At this point, only back under 76.50 would negate outlook and give reason for concern. 
$$$$
GBP/USD:  Gains have stalled out just shy of the 200-Day SMA for now and the market looks to be entering a fresh period of consolidation before considering the next major move. Key levels to watch above and below come in by 1.5930 and 1.5645 respectively, and a daily close above or below will be required for clearer directional bias. A close below 1.5645 could open the door for some broader underlying bearish resumption, while back above 1.5930 exposes the October highs by 1.6170 further up. 
$$$$
USD/CHF: Although our overall outlook remains intensely bullish, the market is in the process of some interday corrective activity before the next major upside extension beyond 0.9600 and towards parity. However, look for any setbacks to be very well supported into the 0.9000 area, with the level representing a key psychological barrier and also coinciding with the lower Bollinger band. For now, a break back above 0.9265 will officially be required to confirm outlook and alleviate immediate downside pressures.
